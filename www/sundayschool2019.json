Through their hard work and dedication, they were\nable to plant churches in the area and strengthen the weak in the midst of hostility.\nAt his retirement service, the pastor encouraged believers in the community to hold fast to\nthe love of God and to walk in obedience to His commands. He also admonished them to\nwalk in the truth, which is the hallmark of believers.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Pastor Ogbeni\\'s admonition is similar to Paul\\'s charge in his letter to the brethren in\nThessalonica. He urged them to pray for him, and his work, stressing their need to hold\nfast to the love of God. Likewise, John, in his second letter, gave this same admonition to\nthe brethren so that they will not be deceived into propagating heresy rather than the\ntruth. This is the focal point of today\\'s lesson.    <\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Request for Prayer 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5   <\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>In chapters one and two of 2 Thessalonians, Paul offered a prayer of thanksgiving, he\naddressed the Man of Lawlessness and encouraged the people to stand firm without\nwavering. But in chapter 3, he requested the church to pray for him and those who\nworked with him. He said, \u201cFinally, brothers, pray for us\u2026.\u201d (v. 1) According to the\npassage, the content of Paul\\'s request was not personal or complex. The prayer request\nwas simple. His desire was that:<ol>\n<li>The message of the Lord would spread rapidly and be received with honour, just like\nthe brethren in Thessalonica received the message without wavering.<\/li>\n<li>God would rescue them from wicked and evil people who probably opposed his\npreaching.<\/li>\n<\/ol>  <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>He, however, testified to the faithfulness of God and His ability to strengthen and\nkeep them safe from the Evil One (the Devil). Undoubtedly, Paul\\'s appeal for prayers\nfrom the brethren is one of the practical ways we can showcase God\\'s love for people\naround us. Interestingly, Paul expressed confidence that the brethren will continue to\ndo what they have been commanded to do. He prayed that God would direct their\nhearts into His love and perseverance that is given by Christ (v. 5).  <\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n<p>A careful examination of Paul\\'s prayer suggests that he and his companions were\nconfronted with challenges in the ministry, especially from those who opposed the spread\nof the Gospel in their days. But in the midst of these challenges, they resolved to hold on to\nthe love of God that sustains. They believed in the efficacy of prayer as a source of strength\nin the face of persecution. This implies that even in our contemporary time, in which\nChristians are being persecuted, we must engage in prevailing prayers against the activities\nof the Evil One and his cohorts. This is one of the ways Christians can be of help to one another. In addition, the church should exemplify and hold on to God\\'s love and\nperseverance as we await Christ\\'s second coming.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss various ways our Christian faith is being challenged today like in the days of\nPaul.   <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What should be our attitude towards those who oppose the spread of the Gospel?\n  <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        <li>Compare and contrast Paul\\'s request and the kind of prayer requests people make in\nour churches today.  <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Admonition to Walk in Love 2 John 4-6<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The second letter of John was written as an encouragement to believers to continue\nto walk in the truth and show God\\'s love to one another. The admonition was\nnecessitated by the widespread of many deceivers (antichrist) who failed to\nacknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (v. 7). However, John expressed joy\nand testified that some believers are walking in the truth according to the command of\nthe Father. He emphasised the need to love one another. Verse 6 encouraged the people\nand explicitly made it clear that the command to love one another means to walk in\ncomplete obedience to God\\'s commands, just as they were taught since they first\nbelieved in Christ.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The biblical command to love one another began in the Old Testament (Leviticus 19:18),\nand it is being re-emphasised here, in the epistle of John. The Scripture is clear that those\nwho are in Christ must showcase their love for God by the way they live, so that they will\nbecome shining examples, like the recipients of John\\'s letter who were commended for\nbeing sources of joy (verse 4). Living a life of love is not optional for Christians; it is God\\'s\ncommand (v. 6). God expects us to show evidence of our sincere love to family members,\ncolleagues, associates, neighbours and everyone we come in contact with. In fact, love can\nbe a means of winning people to Christ and a way of helping fellow Christians during\nchallenging times. Unfortunately, some Christians still find it difficult to love, despite God\\'s\nrepeated command to love one another.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss some of the ways Christians betray the love of God today. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss practical ways Christians can demonstrate God\\'s love to one\nanother.  <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        <li>A class member should share his\/her experience of a time in his\/her life when it was difficult to show love to others.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 3-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray that God will enable you to hold on to His command and to love till the end.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray that God should help you to be exemplary in the demonstration of His love to all.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n        <li>Ask God to help you live in the truth continually.  <\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Encourage class members to pray collectively for all Christians to hold fast to God\\'s love,\nno matter the challenges of life.<\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Christians should deliberately resolve to obey God\\'s command to love one another.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Believers should live daily to showcase the love of God.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>We cannot claim to know God without a practical demonstration of love towards\npeople around us.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>All Christians must work hard in order to spread the gospel message.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>We should not be ignorant of the activities of wicked people around who are working\nagainst the spread of the Gospel.<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":2,"title":"submit to god in love","message":"<center>\n\n\n            <h4> January 13, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n\n            <h3>SUBMIT TO GOD IN LOVE<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n\n        <div>\n\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Proverbs 3:27-35<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n\n        <p> Background Scripture:James 4:1-10<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\n\n      \n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n\n        \n        <p>Come near to God and he will come near to you.

As usual, all the Iaspirants and their supporters travelled from one town to another campaigning,\n\nmaking promises, and canvassing for votes. Most of the time, when supporters of\n\ndifferent parties crossed one another\\'s path while campaigning, they fought because of\n\ntheir inordinate ambition and self-interest. Despite the involvement of some of them in\n\nritual killings, voters\\' manipulations, lying, falsification of results and other ungodly\n\nactivities, the winner emerged from a non-prominent and relatively new party. During\n\nthe swearing-in ceremony, the Governor-elect, whose humility and reverence for God\n\nwas glaring, admonished the people to always submit themselves to God in love, avoid\n\nselfish ambition as well as the desire to amass wealth. He, therefore, pledged to serve\n\nthe people with great devotion and zeal.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Today\\'s lesson focuses on James\\' exhortation in his letter to the brethren to submit\n\nthemselves to God in love and avoid friendship with the world. God is love and the\n\nAuthor of peace. Therefore, He expects all believers to submit to Him in love and not by\n\ncoercion. In addition, we must consciously and constantly align our values with God\\'s\n\nbecause it is the only way to demonstrate our submission, obedience and love to Him.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>Warning against Ungodly Desires James 4:1-3<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Apostle James began this chapter by stating the causes of quarrels and fights among the\n\npeople, which were due to their desires for pleasure. These inordinate desires were\n\nconstantly at war within them. His emphasis in verse 2 is a demonstration of how these\n\ninordinate desires can lead to covetousness, quarrel, fight, murder and unmet needs. Of\n\ncourse, the reason is obvious; they do not ask from God. According to verse 3, even when\n\nthey ask from God, they do not receive because of their self-seeking motives.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>As James rightly stated, the origin of covetousness, quarrel, fight and wars among\n\npeople is as a result of the desire to get rich, purposely for self-interest. It is common to\n\nsee people, even Christians, engage in dubious activities like stealing, manipulation of\n\nfigures, ritual killings and cheating in order to become rich. Unfortunately, since the fall\n\nof humankind in the garden of Eden, human desires have constantly been in conflict with\n\nGod\\'s. Even today, the urge for material things has increased and as such, there is\n\nconstant conflict, which has led to fight, confusion, wars, destruction of lives and\n\nproperties and troubles in human life. Therefore, Apostle James\\' stern warning against\n\nsuch desires becomes necessary.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Apart from the few that are mentioned in the lesson, list some ungodly activities\n\npeople are engaged in for their selfish interest.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>Conflicts can be avoided in families and in the church, if our desires are aligned with\n\nGod\\'s.

In verse 4, he addressed them as\n\n\u201cadulterous people\", meaning \\'unfaithful or disloyal people\\'. He asked them rhetorically,\n\n\"... don\\'t you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?\" He made it clear\n\nthat anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world will automatically become an enemy\n\nof God because the two are not at par and can never coexist. Thus the Scripture says, \u201cGod\n\nopposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\u201d (v. 6b) It is a warning to Christians\n\nagainst pledging their allegiance to the world rather than to God. Any Christian, who\n\nchooses to pay allegiance to the world cannot be a friend of God (v. 4). There is no way an\n\nindividual can hold on to the world and still enjoy the favour of God. God\\'s desire for\n\nhumankind is to have the totality of our allegiance, cause His Spirit to dwell in us so we can\n\nenjoy His favour. Simply put, there is no room for dual loyalty or allegiance.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The word \\'Adulterous\\' as used in the passage relates to the Old Testament tradition\n\nwherein God\\'s relationship with His people is likened to a marriage relationship. Those\n\nwho are spiritually unfaithful, loving the world rather than God, are called \u201cadulterers\u201d.\n\nHence, Christians are to desist from dual loyalty and pay unalloyed allegiance to God.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Share with class members any personal experience of struggle over allegiance to God\n\nand the world.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>Discuss some consequences of friendship with the world and the benefits of\n\nfriendship with God.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\n\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\n        \t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>Encouragement to Submit to God James 4:7-10<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Apostle James\\' letter is full of warnings and words of encouragement. Some of his\n\nwarnings include:<ol>\n\n<li>To surrender their totality to God as the only antidote for pride and arrogance.<\/li>\n\n<li>To stand firm against the wiles of the Devil.<\/li>\n\n<li>To come near to God, so that He will come near to them.<\/li>\n\n<li>To wash their hands and purify their hearts (i.e. to prepare themselves to come\n\nbefore the Lord like a Jewish religious leader would do before he offered sacrifices\n\nat the altar).<\/li>\n\n<li>To be sorrowful, and weep in penitent sobriety.<\/li>\n\n<li>To cry instead of laugh, and change their joy to gloom in lowly repentance.<\/li>\n\n<li>To humble themselves before the Lord so that He will lift them up.<\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The word \\'Submit\\' is the same as to surrender, to yield or succumb to someone\n\nelse\\'s authority. James knew the activities of the Devil who constantly makes humankind\n\nto sin against God. He, therefore, carefully explained what the people needed to\n\novercome. It is not possible for one to be fulfilled in life all by oneself. Hence, James\n\n  counsels that we should submit to God His way and authority willingly so that we can\n\nreceive His grace and power to resist the Devil, thereby refusing him an opportunity to\n\nmanipulate or gain a foothold in our lives as well as in the church of God.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>What can the church do to ensure that all members submit to God\n\ntotally?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>Can a class member share what he\/she has benefitted as a result of total submission\n\nto God?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\n\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\n        <\/ol>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n\n        \n        <ul>\n\n        \n        <li>Pray that God will help you to submit to Him in totality.\n\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n\n        <li>Pray that the Devil who instigates people against God will not succeed over your life.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\n        <li>Pray and ask that God will purge the church of all forms of worldliness.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\n\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n\n\t\t <p>Class members should share practical experiences of how:<\/p>\n\n        \n        <ul>\n\n        \n        <li>A church that is torn apart as a result of conflict can be helped.<\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\n\n\t\t<li>A supposed Christian whose allegiance is to the world can be helped.<\/li>\n\n               \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n\n        <ul>\n\n\n        <li>Quarrelling and fighting are signs of worldliness.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n\n        <li>God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n\n        <li>Christians are to show example by being totally submissive to God.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n\n        <li>When we humble ourselves before God, He will lift us up.

He is well respected both in the church and Mthe community for his exemplary Christian lifestyle. He is a Senior Marketing\nOfficer with one of the most popular communication companies. Although Mr\nJohnson was innocent, he was accused of fraud and was arrested alongside some of his\ncolleagues. While the case was being investigated, they were all remanded in prison\ncustody for some months. Mr Johnson did not give in to dejection or regret, rather he used\nevery opportunity he had to preach Christ to his fellow prisoners. The testimony is that\nmany gave their lives to Christ. Eventually, Mr Johnson was pronounced innocent and thus\nwas discharged and acquitted. During his thanksgiving service, he declared that his\n experience in prison was for a divine purpose to preach the Gospel. His experience can be\nlikened to the case of Apostle Paul who yielded himself wholly to God, to the extent that\nhe was willing to die for the cause of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He affirmed that what had\nhappened to him really served to advance the Gospel and not to hinder it.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>God sometimes allows the faith of His children to be tested for the furtherance of\nthe gospel message of our Lord Jesus Christ, like the case of Paul. Even though Paul was in\nchains and his movement restricted, he was still able to preach the gospel of salvation with\npassion. His courage and boldness, which came from the Lord, finally motivated him to\npreach fearlessly. Today\\'s lesson focuses on the need to submit to God in Christ, whether\nin persecution, suffering or in the face of death, like Paul declared in this passage.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Paul\\'s Testimony Philippians 1:12-14<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the church in Philippi while he was in prison. Because of\nhis inability to visit the church as a result of his imprisonment, he decided to give them a\nprogress report of the ministry. According to verse 1 Paul said, \u201cI want you to know, my\nbrothers, that the things that have happened to me has really served to advance the\ngospel.\u201d His joy was that his suffering, which could possibly be in form of hunger,\nviolence, injustice, evil plots, isolation and denial, eventually turned out to advance the\ncause of the Gospel, instead of hindering it. His hope was perpetually kept alive, even in\nthe face of difficulty and on account of this, he testified about three things that\nhappened, viz:<ol>\n<li>It became known throughout the palace guard and among everyone that he is in\nprison because he is a servant of Christ.<\/li>\n<li>The brethren in Philippi had more confidence in the Lord.<\/li>\n<li>They became bold and were able to speak the Word fearlessly.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s reaction to his prison experiences and troubles is astounding. The experience did\nnot slow down his preaching assignment neither did he give in to regret, dejection or\ncomplaints. The other brethren were encouraged to proclaim the Word with more\nboldness and zeal. From inception, the church has been faced with persecution. Jesus Christ was persecuted, likewise the early apostles Paul, Stephen and others. Presently,\nthere is still much persecution of Christians all over the world. Nevertheless, today\\'s\nlesson should serve as motivation to us to remain steadfast. We should continue to keep\nhope alive, having the assurance that what we suffer in this present age cannot be\ncompared with the glory that will be revealed in us at the end of age (Romans 8:18). This\nwas Paul\\'s source of boldness.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Highlight different forms of persecution Christians are facing today.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Why is it difficult for many Christians to endure hardship in our time?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Serving God with the Right Motive Philippians 1:15-19<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Having testified of how his imprisonment had advanced the proclamation of the Gospel, Paul\nalso carefully analysed how some people preach the Gospel for positive and negative\nreasons. He said in verse 15, \u201cIt is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but\nothers out of goodwill.\u201d He explained that those who preached the Gospel out of goodwill did\nso in love because they knew that he was in prison for the defence of the Gospel. They truly\nrecognised the reason for Paul\\'s imprisonment. However, others simply preached Christ for\ntheir selfish ambition so that they will cause more trouble for him while in prison (vv. 16-17).\n Paul\\'s major concern was that Christ is preached, whether with right or wrong motives he\nkept on rejoicing. He expressed confidence in verse 19 that the prayers of the brethren and\nthe help given by the Spirit through Jesus Christ would bring about his deliverance.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>One of the evidences of genuine submission to God is our sincere service to Him. As\nPaul rightly observed, many people are preaching the Gospel with different motives.\nWhile some do so out of envy, self-ambition, and to make names for themselves, there\nare still some who preach and see the gospel message as a task that must be done. Our\nservice to God should flow out of genuine faith in Christ Jesus. Therefore, competition,\nenvy, rivalry, greed or selfishness should not be encouraged.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Mention some wrong motives why people engage in Christian activities today.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What do you think was the source of Paul\\'s courage to forge ahead, despite his\nchain?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n        \t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Keeping Hope Alive Philippians 1:20-21<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>certainty about his deliverance from prison in verse 19 is worth mentioning. The conviction\n is followed by his earnest desire and hope not to fail in his duty to preach the Gospel. As a\nresult, he eagerly desired to have sufficient courage so that he will bring honour to Christ,\nwhether in life or in death. The statement is confirmed in verse 21 when he said, \u201cFor to me,to live is Christ and to die is gain.\u201d Invariably, Paul means that life is all about Jesus Christ.\nThis is confirmed in verse 23 when he confessed his desire to depart and be with Christ.\n\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Generally, Paul\\'s experience in prison was enough reason for him to ignore his service\nto Christ but he resolved to keep his hope alive in Christ. This suggests that Christianity is\nassociated with suffering, persecution, denial and even death. However, in the midst of\nthese troubles, we are expected to keep our hopes alive with the assurance that the glory\nthat shall be revealed at the end of age will be more glorious than the present suffering.\nWe should remain committed to God like Paul who resolved to preach the Gospel and live\nfor God, despite his challenges. The church should be involved in meaningful discipleship\nso as to develop members who will be totally committed to God in all circumstances of life.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>In terms of total submission to the cause of Christ, what is the difference between the\nearly and contemporary Christians?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>\"To live is Christ and to die is gain.\" Discuss.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Ask God to uphold you in the Christian race to the end.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray that God will use the current persecution against Christians in Nigeria to win\nmore souls to Himself.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n        <li>Pray for all greedy ministers of God to repent and forsake their selfish desires.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n\t\t <p>Christians should discuss practically:<\/p>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>How the example of Jesus\\' sacrifice can spur Christians to submit fully to God.<\/li> <!-- Fellowship Activity 1-->\n\t\t<li>Jesus said, \"By their fruit you shall know them.\" Discuss the fruits that can portray\nChristians as self serving.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Any Christian service done out of wrong motive will not be rewarded.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Preaching the Gospel is the ultimate task of the church.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>We must resolve to serve God with the right motive.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>A Christian must resolve to live for God, no matter the persecution.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>Our steadfastness in the face of persecution can serve as motivation to others to\nremain faithful in their service to God.<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul>\n"},{"id":4,"title":"devote all to christ","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4> January 27, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>DEVOTE ALL TO CHRIST<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Psalm 119:65-72<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Philippians 2:1-11<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\n      \n\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit,\nbut in humility consider others better than yourselves.<b>Philippians 2:3<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n        <p>Teaching Method:Group Discussion.\nTo encourage members to participate, the\nleader should assign the questions under\neach subtitle ahead of the class.\nThe teacher should prepare to give a hint\non or\/and provide answers to all questions\nfor discussion.\nGive attention to suitable sitting\narrangement.<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Mention ways Christians can uphold\nthe unity of the church.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Identify the characteristics of Jesus\nChrist as stated in the passage.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Share their resolve to henceforth show\ngreater humility and give more honour\nto others than themselves.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Late \\'Baba Counsellor\\', as he was popularly called, was a mentor and a church Lplanter. During his lifetime, he worked selflessly and devoted all to Jesus Christ\nwithout any selfish ambition. He had many disciples who walked closely with him.\nHis lifestyle was a model of a true Christian mentor who loves God and works with\nenthusiasm. Once a year, Baba Counsellor organised a conference for all his disciples. In\none of his meetings, before his death, he made a passionate appeal to his disciples to be\nlike-minded, imitate Jesus\\' humility and devote all to Jesus Christ. The life of Baba\nCounsellor can be likened to that of Apostle Paul, in today\\'s lesson. In chapter two of his\nletter to the church in Philippi, he encouraged the brethren to live a life of total devotion\nto Jesus Christ by imitating His humility.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>\u2018To devote\\' means to dedicate or set aside something for a specific purpose. The life\nof a Christian should be set apart for the purpose of Jesus Christ and His kingdom. What\nhas sustained the Christian faith till today is the act of faithful devotion. Jesus Himself,\nwho was devoted to the cross to save the world, is our ultimate example. Interestingly,\nHis disciples followed His example in their devotion to the cause of the Gospel. The early\nchurch built upon the foundation of the apostles by devoting all to Jesus. What can we\nsay about the early Christian missionaries who forsook their comfort, and devoted their\nlives to the cause of missions? The focus of today\\'s lesson is Paul\\'s appeal to the church in\nPhilippi to devote all to Christ.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Admonition to Uphold Christian Unity Philippians 2:1-4<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s plea centres on Jesus\\' humility and the bond of unity among the brethren. To make\nhis joy complete, Paul urged the Philippians to have the same mind, share the same love\nand be united in spirit and purpose. Notable in the passage also is the warning against\ndoing anything from selfish ambition or vainglory, which are enemies of unity and\nharmony in the church. In contrast, he encouraged them to demonstrate Christian\nattitude through humility and consider others better than themselves (v. 3). The\nadmonition is repeated in verse 4 when he said, \u201cEach of you should look not only to your\nown interests, but also to the interest of others.\u201d It was an encouragement to avoid\ndiscrimination among them. It was to promote Christian unity and equal concern for the\ninterest of others as a Christian community.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Paul admonished the Christians in Philippi to showcase their union with Christ by\n\u201cbeing like-minded, having the same love, one in Spirit and of one mind.\u201d (v. 2) In this\nway, Christianity will become a lifestyle that clearly portrays our union with Christ, which\nwill present Christians to the world as united people. This can be made possible if we\nconsider what Paul said in verses 3-4 (equal concern for all).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss some signs of disunity in the church.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What can you do personally to ensure there is unity in the church?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Admonition to Imitate Jesus\\' Humility Philippians 2:5-8<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>It is obvious from Paul\\'s letter that he was really interested in the unity and love among\nthe brethren in the church in Philippi, which is the foundation of a healthy church. He\nwas specific in his appeal in verse 5. He said, \u201cYour attitude should be the same as that of\nChrist Jesus.\u201d The Philippians should be ready to display the qualities of Jesus Christ as\nenumerated from verses 6 to 8. For instance, Jesus demonstrated humility in these ways:<ol>\n<li>Even though He had the nature of God, He did not claim to be equal with Him;<\/li>\n<li>He made Himself nothing by giving up His position as a Son to become a servant;<\/li>\n<li>He became a human being and appeared in human likeness, even though He is\nGod;<\/li>\n<li>He humbled Himself and became obedient to death on the cross.<\/li>\n<\/ol>Jesus\\' humility as it is seen in the passage is worth mentioning. Though He is fully God,\nHe humbled Himself to the point of saving humanity, through His death on the cross as a\nsacrificial Lamb. He laid aside His dignity, honour, position and authority for the salvation\nof humankind. He submitted to the will of His Father.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Humility is a Christian virtue and Jesus has laid the example. Therefore, to imitate His\nhumility, Christians should be ready to deal with self and ego, which places barrier\n between us and our devotion to God. We are to be humble assuming the position of a\nservant. By so doing, there will be love, peace, equality, and harmony in the church.

In the same manner,\nChristians who are devoted to God will be rewarded. But if we allow the flesh to hold\n sway on our commitment to Him, our eternal rewards may be lost.

His slogan became: \u201cTo know Christ Jesus is my utmost joy.\nMy earthly materials do not mean anything to me any longer\u201d.

Our focus today is on Paul\\'s desire to know more about Jesus\nChrist, the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in His suffering so that\nhe could become like Christ, even in death.

Though\nPaul himself once possessed the righteousness that comes from the law, which his\nopponents now preached (see vv. 4-6), he had a change of perspective on the\ninterpretation and application of the law when he encountered the Lord. He confessed,\n\u201cWhatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.\u201d (v. 7) This implies\nthat everything in life is futile without the knowledge of Christ. Paul made a decision to\nforsake all when he considered the greatness of the surpassing glory of knowing and\ngaining Jesus Christ.

His desire to know Christ was not just a factual knowledge, but to have a\npersonal relationship with Him. For this reason, he chose to forsake all for the purpose of\nhaving a personal and steady relationship with Christ Jesus, which he enjoyed till his\ndeath. This is a reminder that our greatest achievement on earth is nothing when\ncompared with the life we enjoy in union with Christ Jesus. This is a worthwhile reminder\nthat our life in Christ Jesus is much more valuable than any worldly attainment.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What is the surpassing greatness that Paul talked about in verse 8?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Let a class member testify about some of the things he\/she forsook for the sake of\nfollowing Christ and the joy that resulted from that decision.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Becoming Like Christ Philippians 3:10-11<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The sincerity of Paul\\'s declaration to forsake all in order to know Christ is seen in verse 10.\nHe expressed his sincere desire to:<ol>\n<li>Know Christ.- Paul\\'s craving was to have the knowledge of Christ, which involves\nknowing Him so intimately that he would become like Him.<\/li>\n<li>Experience the power of His resurrection; the extraordinary divine power by which\nJesus Christ was raised from the dead (Ephesians 1:20).<\/li>\n<li>Have a share of His suffering.

To attest to this declaration, Paul laboured and died in\nthe cause of preaching the Gospel. Unfortunately today, many Christians are\ndesirous to know Christ\\'s love, healing, deliverance, prosperity, advancement,\npromotion, etc. but they do not want to have a share in His suffering, death and, even\nHis resurrection. The Bible clearly states, \u201c\u2026 if we died with him, we will also live with\nhim; if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown\nus; if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.\u201d (2\nTimothy 2:11-13) According to this passage, the condition to attain Jesus\\' personality\nand live with Him is readiness to die with Him, not minding our earthly\naccomplishments.

He, however, confessed that he had not attained the goal;\nneither had he been made perfect. Rather, he kept striving toward the goal of knowing\nChrist. This is expressed in verse 13. Paul\\'s strategy of attaining the goal was to forget\nwhat is behind (his previous achievements) and strive towards what is ahead. He would\ncontinue to press on toward the goal in order to win the prize, which is the call of God\nthrough Jesus Christ (v. 14). The prize, as used in the passage, is the Christian reward of\neverlasting glory in God\\'s presence.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>By human standard, Paul would have been adjudged a perfect man but he said, \u201cNot\nthat I have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect\u2026.\u201d (v. 12) This\nhonest and objective self-appraisal helped Paul to keep pressing on, forgetting his\nprevious achievements with the earnest desire to do more for the Lord. The challenge is\nthat it is awful to assume spiritual maturity without judging oneself in the light of God\\'s\nWord like Paul, whose desire was to win the prize (v. 14). By implication, Paul was ready\nto do everything to get the crown. In 1 Corinthians 9:26-27 he said, \u201cTherefore I do not\nrun like a man running aimlessly. I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my\nbody and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others; I will not be\ndisqualified for the prize.\u201d The one requirement, according to this lesson, is to renounce\neverything that leads to self-glorification and continue to strive to win the prize.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Mention some of the distractions that can prevent an athlete from winning the\nprize and relate same to our Christian race.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>When will the prize be won and how best can we get prepared for it?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Thank the Lord for the salvation Jesus Christ brings through His sacrificial death on\nthe cross.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray that you will not get carried away\/distracted by your past activities.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n        <li>Pray for grace to continue to press on until Christ comes.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\n\t\t  <li>Pray that you will not miss the prize of your calling as a Christian.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 4-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Identify some people in your church who have this same passion (for Christ) like Paul.\nWrite a letter of encouragement to them not to relent in their effort.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>There should be a difference between our old lifestyle and the new.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>As Christians, we should aspire daily to advance in our spiritual journey until we reign\nwith Christ.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Do not allow your past successes or failures to hinder you from making progress in\nyour spiritual journey.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>No worldly achievement can be compared with the surpassing greatness of knowing\nChrist.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>Every Christian should eagerly desire to know Christ, His resurrection and share in His\nsuffering.<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":6,"title":"pondering god's steadfast love","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4> February 10, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>PONDERING GOD'S STEADFAST LOVE<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Psalm 93<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Psalm 48:1-3, 9-14<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\n\t\t\n\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>For this God is our God forever and ever;\nhe will be our guide even to the end.<b>Psalms 48:14<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n        <p>Teaching Method:Group Discussion.\nTo encourage members to participate, the\nleader should assign the questions under\neach subtitle ahead of the class.\nThe teacher should prepare to give a hint\non or\/and provide answers to all questions\nfor discussion.\nGive attention to suitable sitting\narrangement.<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Discuss God\\'s great deeds among\npeople in our time.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Relate God\\'s greatness to His love for\nhumanity.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Write down their acknowledgment of\nthe greatness of God and willingness\nto live a life that will qualify them to\npraise Him eternally.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>It was another Sunday school class. The topic was \u201cGod\\'s Rich Mercy\u201d. The teacher Iwas quite articulate as she made the class members meditate on the mercy of God.\nSuddenly, a young man started sobbing uncontrollably to the amazement of others.\nShortly after, he confided in the teacher that whenever he pondered on the rich mercy of\nGod and His steadfast love toward him, despite his past lifestyle of stealing, killing,\ndrunkenness and adultery, he felt inadequate to stand before God. The story of Esau and\nJacob in the Bible illustrates God\\'s steadfast love to those He has chosen according to His\neternal purpose. It is an indication that God\\'s steadfast love does not depend on\nhumankind\\'s desire or effort, but on God\\'s mercy (Romans 9:16). God said to Moses, \"I\nwill have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will\nhave compassion.\" (Romans 9:15) Even today, God\\'s steadfast love toward His people is\nbeyond description. One of our age-long choruses is apt here. It says:\nThe steadfast love of the Lord never ceaseth,\nHis mercies never come to an end;\nThey are new every morning, new every morning,\nGreat is Thy faithfulness, O Lord\nGreat is Thy faithfulness.\u201d\nThe psalmist in our lesson today calls on all people of the earth to think about God\\'s\nsteadfast love, which He freely bestows on His children according to His divine purpose.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Ponder on the Greatness of God Psalm 48:1-3<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>One of the characteristics of King David is his constant meditation on the greatness of\nGod and His mighty power. In verse 1, he publicly acknowledges the greatness of the\nLord and declares that He is most worthy of praise in the city of God, his holy mountain.\nHe further describes the height, security and the beauty of Mount Zion, compares it with\nthe heights of Zaphon, and called it the city of the Great King. This great city brings joy to\nthe whole world. According to verse 3, he said God has shown that, with Him, there is\nsafety inside the fortress of the city.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>This psalm was probably a Levitical song used to celebrate the security of Zion. The\nopening verse celebrates the greatness of the God of Zion, to whom all praises must be\nascribed because of His greatness. Mount Zion, the city of God is a holy mountain and is\nrevered because God is in her citadels (v. 3). Consequently, the great God has become\nher fortification against her enemies so much that when the kings gathered together to\nattack the city, they were amazed, afraid of what they saw and ran away (v. 4). As Mount\nZion is celebrated because of the greatness of God who resides there, so Christians must\nponder and celebrate God in their homes and local churches. In like manner, our bodies\nthat have become the temple of God must be fully dedicated to God. The summary is\nthat the greatness of God must be well-celebrated in our individual lives, as children of\nGod.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Jerusalem is often referred to as the city of God.

As they praise God, His fame spreads to the ends of the earth.\nPrecisely, this verse points to God\\'s generous and unfailing love towards His chosen\nones. The result is that Mount Zion rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of\nGod\\'s righteous judgments by which He rose to defend Zion, His own city.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Today, Christians should ponder on God\\'s greatness and generosity towards them.\nWe should also ponder on God\\'s right judgments by which He has acted in our defense.\nMore so, His steadfast love has been manifested in our lives and all that pertains to us.\nThe height of God\\'s love for humanity is the release of His only Son, Jesus Christ, to\nredeem us (John 3:16). Having given us this unique gift, what else can He not freely\nrelease to us? (Romans 8:32) The best way to respond to Him is to continually think\nabout His love, justice and generosity and then praise Him.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss in practical terms the unfailing love of God.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What can you say about God\\'s righteous judgments?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n        \t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Ponder on God\\'s Goodness Psalm 48:12-14<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>As the psalmist concludes, he confidently commands God\\'s people to walk around Zion\nand carefully consider her fortifications. This probably refers to the security, and beauty of\nZion, the city of God. The reason for the command is stated in verse 13b, \u201c\u2026that you may\ntell of them to the next generation.\u201d Undoubtedly, the psalmist wants the people to tell the\nnext generation about the wonders of God, which He had done among them so that they\nwill continue to ponder on them and give Him praise. He concludes with an affirmation that\nGod who has been good to His people will continue to be their God and guide.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The need for Christians to continually think about the goodness of God, His grace and\nsteadfast love cannot be over-emphasised. When we do this from time to time, it will\nbecome our attitude and this can be transferred to the next generation. Therefore, we need\nto keep record of God\\'s goodness to us. In our churches, families and as individuals, we must\ndocument what the future generation will see and remember the faithfulness of God\ntowards us. The result of such record is a display of our loyalty to God by declaring also: \u201cFor\nthis God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even to the end.\u201d (v. 14).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the evidence of God\\'s unfailing love towards you.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Highlight some spectacular deeds of God in your church that you can proudly share\nwith the upcoming generation.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Thank God for His unfailing love towards you.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray that your lifestyle will affect the next generation positively, to the glory of God.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2--><li>Ask God to continue to be your guide and guard, especially in this evil generation.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Visit someone this week and rejoice with him\/her concerning God\\'s blessings upon\nhis\/her life.<\/li>\n<li>Share with someone this week some great deeds of God you have experienced to\nstrengthen his\/her faith.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>God is great and most worthy of our praise.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>God\\'s presence is a sure security for all believers.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>God is our Mighty Fortress.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>Christians should meditate on God\\'s unfailing love and give Him quality praise always.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>It is our duty, as Christians, to tell the next generation about the greatness of God in\nour lives.<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":7,"title":"praising god for his mighty works","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4> February 17, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>PRAISING GOD FOR HIS MIGHTY WORKS<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Psalm 114<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Psalm 66<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\n\t\t<p>Lesson Scripture: Psalm 66:1-9, 16-20<\/p>\n\t\t\n\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Shout with joy to God, all the earth!<b>Psalm 66:1<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n        <p>Teaching Method:Live Demonstration.\nAssign three volunteer members to give\nlive testimonies in line with the three subtopics\nin this study.\nLet them write their stories, edit them and\nhave them read.

After the fifth day, he observed that other abductees who were kept in the\nsame room with him were being slaughtered one after the other. Then, he made a vow to\npraise God if released alive. Eventually, he was released without harm. He offered\nthanksgiving to God in fulfilment of his vow. King David, the author of this psalm, in like\nmanner, offered thanksgiving to God when he was rescued from the hands of his\nenemies and thereafter, offered sacrifices to Him in the temple.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>One of the attributes of God is that He is omnipresent.

He begins with an\ninvitation to shout with joy, glory and praise to God. He calls on the people to:<ol>\n<li>Praise God for His wonderful deeds as a result of deliverance from his enemies.<\/li>\n<li>Praise God in response to the display of His power, which makes the enemies\ncringe before Him.

Indeed, the passage is a\nreflection of God\\'s preservation of the Israelites as they passed on dry land through\nthe Red Sea (vv. 5-7).

He confirms how he cried out to\nGod with his mouth. His declaration in verses 18 and 19 suggests that his prayer was\nactually answered because he regarded no iniquity in his heart. This may be so because his sins have been forgiven, or another indication that repentance is required before\nprayers can be answered. Therefore, he praised God who did not reject his prayer or\nwithdraw His constant love from him. Remarkably, the psalmist called an assembly and\nproclaimed what God had done for him.

They left Ibadan early, having estimated the journey to be\n\nabout 9 hours. Unfortunately, they could not make it to their destination that same day.\n\nApart from the fact that the roads were bad, the vehicle developed some faults and finally\n\nbroke down on the highway, late in the night. All efforts to fix the vehicle failed. They\n\neventually resolved to pass the night at that spot since there was no village or hotel in\n\nsight. They were overwhelmed with fear because of the problem of insurgency and\n\nrobbery attack, which was prevalent in the area. None of them could actually sleep.\n\nInstead, they started to sing and recite all the memory verses they had learnt from\n\nSunbeam. They repeated Psalm 91 several times knowing that it is a psalm of assurance of\n\nGod\\'s security in time of trouble. God saw them through. They were kept safe and the\n\njourney went smoothly the next day because they trusted God for safety and protection.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n<p>The crux of today\\'s lesson is the need to trust God for security whenever we are in trouble.\n\nEven though we do not see Him physically, His presence, protection and provision are assured,\n\nespecially for those who trust in Him. This is the declaration made by the author of this psalm\n\nwho probably was one of the temple personnel (a priest or Levite). It is rather unfortunate these\n\ndays that some people, even Christians, put their trust in their riches, some powerful\n\npoliticians, and charms for protection without the consciousness that they are short-term\n\nwhen compared with the power of God.<\/p>\n\n\n     \n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>God Promises Protection Psalm 91:1-4<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Psalm 91 is an acknowledgment of one who has confidence in God and trusts Him for\n\nprotection and security from all perils. The psalm is assumed to have been written to give\n\nencouragement to the faithful and committed temple worshippers. The statement in verse 1\n\nmeans everyone who trusts God and remains under His protection can say with confidence\n\nthat He (God) is their Defender and Protector. Principally, the psalmist describes God\\'s\n\nprotection using three symbols in verse 4. He said:<ol>\n\n<li>God will cover you with His feathers. This can be likened to a mother hen that spreads\n\nand covers her chicks with her feathers to protect them from their enemies\\' aggression.<\/li>\n\n<li>Under God\\'s wings, they will find a place of safety.<\/li>\n\n<li>God\\'s faithfulness will be their shelter and fortress.<\/li>\n\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>We live in a society that is characterised by wickedness and rebellion against humankind\n\nand God. Each day, we hear about incessant killings, kidnappings, child rape\/trafficking,\n\ndestruction of valuable properties, unlawful arrests and other criminal cases. People live\n\nin constant fear because they cannot predict what the future holds. As a result, some have\n\nresorted to seeking safety and help from ungodly sources. However, according to the\n\nauthor of this psalm, protection is sure for those who trust in the shadow of the Almighty.\n\nThey will be protected against every form of attacks from the enemy. The covering by the\n\nfeathers, as used in the passage, is a metaphor for the protective outreach of God\\'s power\n\nover everyone who trusts in Him. The challenge is that Christians should live in the\n\nconsciousness of the fact that God can protect them, no matter the threat of the enemies.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Discuss the implication of God delivering us from the fowler\\'s snare.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>How can God\\'s faithfulness become our shield and fortress?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n\n        <\/li> \n\n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>God Promises His Care Psalm 91:5-8, 11-13<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The psalmist was detailed in this text about what God can do, perhaps from experience.\n\nHaving talked about God\\'s protection, he encouraged his readers not to be afraid. He\n\ncarefully analysed the different threats and the time they operate. For instance in verses\n\n5 and 6 he said, \u201cYou will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,\n\nnor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that despite the threat, they will only observe and see the wicked\n\nbeing punished if only they will make the Most High God their dwelling place. The reason\n\nfor their defence is given in verses 11 to 13. Even though they tread upon the lion and\n\ncobra (symbols of dangers for enemies), they will be protected because God Himself will\n\ncommand His angels to guard them in all their ways. Therefore, they will not strike their\n\nfoot against a stone. The Devil quoted these same verses when he tempted Jesus (Luke\n\n4:9-12). But Jesus had no need to test the power of God\\'s Word; neither did He come into\n\nthe world for showmanship.\n\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The psalmist is aware of some things that may serve as threat to human life.

The assurance is based on the fact that He\n\ncares enough to save His children from them all. Therefore, they will only watch and see\n\nhow the wicked will be punished for their evil deeds (v.8). Unfortunately today, some\n\npeople are so afraid that they have resorted to charms, some personalities, and family\n\ninfluence for safety; by so doing, they despise the power of God to save from all dangers.\n\nChristians should be reminded that even today, God\\'s love, care, protection and\n\nguidance are sure for those who trust in Him.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Discuss some examples of pestilences and plagues and how devastating they can\n\nbe.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>List God\\'s promises in verses 11-13 and state how Christians can sustain them.\n\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\n\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\n        \t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>God Promises Life Psalm 91:14-16<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>As the psalmist concludes his message, he highlights God\\'s promise of love for His\n\npeople.

Obviously, the reason for the promise is His love for them (v. 14). God loves us and wants\n\nus to reciprocate by loving Him through total obedience to His commands. In fact, the climax\n\nof God\\'s love for humankind prompted Him to release His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ\n\nthrough whom we have received forgiveness and gained salvation (John 3:16).

The bride\\'s friends who dressed in a particular uniform\ncame to church earlier than others and so they occupied the first few pews, despite the\nwarning by the ushers that the seats were reserved for some special guests. Not long after,\nthey were forced out of the place when the Governor of the State and his entourage came.\nShamefully, they sat outside throughout the programme because there was no more space\nin the church auditorium. This, of course, was as a result of pride and arrogance.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The above story summarises Jesus\\' teaching about humility and hospitality to the\npoor and vulnerable. He emphasised the need to demonstrate humility instead of pride\nand show generosity to the poor. Every human being has the tendency to be proud and\nself-centred as a result of the evil nature we inherited. Jesus, however, taught that\nanyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\nToday\\'s topic is a reminder that humility and hospitality are virtues that must be\nexhibited by Christians.\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Beauty of Humility Luke 14:7-11<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>It is likely that in Jesus\\' days, there was a prevalent custom that informs the sitting\narrangement for invited guests at a dinner. The central position was usually considered\nthe place of highest honour and reserved for the most important guest. According to the\npassage, Jesus went to eat in the home of a prominent Pharisee on a Sabbath day. While\nHe was there, He watched with keen interest and noticed how the guests scrambled for\nthe place of highest honour (usually a place next to the host) at the table. His observation\nnecessitated the parable. He warned against choosing the best place whenever they are\ninvited to a wedding feast because it could lead to embarrassment and disgrace, if the\nplace is reserved for more important persons. In verse 10, He recommended that they\nshould choose the lowest place instead so that they will be honoured as the host will\nlead them to the highest place. Invariably, they are to show humility by not struggling to\noccupy the place of highest honour. The reason for Jesus\\' counsel is stated in verse 11,\n\u201cFor everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be\nexalted.\u201d In fact, this principle should not be strange to the Jewish audience because its\nimportance is explicitly stated in the Laws (Proverbs 25:6-7).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Humility is the act of exhibiting modesty, showing unassuming nature and the opposite\nof pride. It is a biblical principle that repeatedly warns that God abhors pride. He opposes\nthe proud but gives grace to the humble (Matthew 23:12; 1 Peter 5:6). Apostle Paul substantiated this fact in his letter to the brethren in Philippi not to do anything out of\nselfish ambition or vain conceit. He recommended that in humility they should consider\nothers better than themselves (Philippians 2:3-5). The counsel applies to all Christians; we\nare to imitate Jesus who demonstrated the highest level of humility, even though He had\nthe nature of God. He did not consider equality with His Father but humbled Himself and\ntook the form of a servant. The beauty of humility is that it usually leads to promotion. The\n example of Jesus\\' humility is worth mentioning He was exalted to the highest place and\ngiven a Name that is above other names.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Differentiate between being ambitious and being proud.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What are some characteristics of a proud person and how can it be\ncontrolled?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Blessedness of Hospitality Luke 14:12-14<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>After Jesus had expressed His concern about the proud disposition of the guests, He laid\nemphasis on the blessedness of hospitality, especially when it is done to the poor. He said,\n\u201cWhen you give a luncheon or dinner; do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives,\nor your rich neighbours; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.\u201d In\ncontrast, the less privileged should be considered whenever there is a feast instead of using\nit for social advantage or to seek reciprocal blessings from the invited guests. The\ninstruction is important so that the blessedness of hospitality will be received by the host at\nthe resurrection of the righteous. It is interesting to note the category of people Jesus\nmentioned in the passage like the poor, crippled, lame, and the blind. These people are\ncertainly helpless and giving to meet their needs will not go unrewarded. It carries eternal\nreward (v. 14; Proverbs 19:17).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>This passage clearly explains the importance of generosity particularly to the less\nprivileged who cannot reciprocate the kindness. Unfortunately, the society we live in,\neven the church is characterised by class, status, self-centredness and factions without\nmuch consideration for the poor. It seems the rich only mingle with the rich, the learned\nwith the learned and the influential relate only with the influential. This attitude will only\nresult to a divided church. After all, the poor are still with us and so the instruction to care\nfor them remains valid. James, the apostle, also warned against showing favouritism\nwhile dealing with the poor. He concluded that God has chosen those who are poor in\nthe eyes of the world to be rich in faith so that they will inherit the kingdom He promised\nthose who love Him (James 2:1-9). However, self-examination and sacrifice are required\nto understand and exemplify Jesus\\' teaching on humility and hospitality.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Have you ever been blessed by somebody you least expected?

When his pastor asked him the reason for abandoning them, he made reference to\nJesus\\' statement in Luke chapter 14 verse 26.

On one occasion, as He\nwalked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee He saw two fishermen, Simon and his\nbrother Andrew, catching fish with their nets. Certainly, Jesus knew the task of the\nministry and so when He saw these men, He said to them, \u201cCome, follow me\u2026 and I will\nmake you fishers of men.\u201d Supposedly, Jesus meant that they will be made to win souls\nfor the kingdom of heaven. According to verse 18, the two brothers abandoned their\nnets and followed Him immediately. The same invitation to follow Jesus was extended to\nthe two sons of Zebedee (James and John) as they were getting their nets ready for their\nfishing business. The two brothers also left their father in the boat with the hired men\nand followed Jesus immediately. It is noteworthy that these people made a conscious\nand deliberate decision to follow Jesus. Their response was prompt, abandoning\neverything including their fishing business and father to follow Jesus (Mark 1:18, 20). So,\ntheir response attests to the fact that the task of the ministry was and is still enormous.\nThe call is indeed costly but its reward can be overwhelming for those who are ready to\nobey and truly follow Him.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus still calls people into the ministry today. Although many people reject such\ncalls because of the challenges and fear of the unknown but Jesus expects a positive\nresponse to follow Him without minding the cost. Just like the fishermen left their\nlucrative fishing business and followed Him without counting the cost, He wants us to also follow Him with dedication; without wavering or considering the challenges that lie\nahead. Christians should know that our response to Jesus\\' call into different ministries in\nthe church is an attestation that we understand the nature of the Great Commission,\nwhich is the main task of every Bible-believing church.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Does following Jesus today necessarily mean to abandon one\\'s secular career like the\nearly disciples did?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What does following Jesus mean and what are the likely challenges?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Call to a Sacrificial Life Luke 14:25-27<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Large crowds often followed Jesus during His earthly ministry. On one occasion, He started to\nteach them what following Him entails and the need for the people to carry their cross daily\nand follow Him. In verse 26, He said, \u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and\n mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters yes, even his own life he cannot be my\ndisciple.\u201d He added that those who will not carry their cross and follow Him cannot be His\ndisciples (v. 27). To carry one\\'s cross suggests a life of sacrifice, which sometimes ends in\npersecution or death for the sake of following Jesus. However, it should be noted that the\nword \u201cHate\u201d as used in this context signifies a relative lack of importance or a way of\nexpressing a greater affection for one person rather than the other.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>To follow Jesus means to abide in Him with an undivided loyalty. It may also mean to\nshare in His suffering, death, burial and resurrection without wavering. The emphases\non self-denial and cross bearing are important because whoever wishes to be a disciple\nmust be ready to pay the price, to bear the insults, shame, mockery and rejection for the\nsake of Christ. Interestingly, the decision to carry one\\'s cross is not a matter of sudden\nimpulse, but of serious commitment to give up everything in order to follow Jesus. This\ndeclaration became necessary because Jesus knew that His would-be followers will\ndefinitely be persecuted and even put to death.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the nature of the cross Jesus\\' disciples were asked to carry and what it\nmeans to us today.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>How would a disciple of Jesus balance his or her love for God and also for his or\nher family? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t<li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Call to Count the Cost Luke 14:28-33<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>matter was so important that He made a comparison between making the decision to\nfollow Him with someone who intends building a tower and a king who is about to go to\nwar. According to Him, anyone who wants to build a house must sit down and estimate the cost to determine if he has enough money to complete the project. The reason for\nthe estimation is to avoid being ridiculed as a result of the inability to complete the\nproject. Likewise, a king who plans to go to war with another king is expected to decide if\nhe is strong enough to win the battle, otherwise he should rather seek for peace. In like\nmanner, Jesus concluded that anyone who does not give up everything he has cannot be\nHis disciple (v. 33). By implication, one of the decisive factors to be a disciple of Jesus,\naccording to the lesson, is to count the cost of following Him and be ready to pay the\nprice without compromise.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>It is evident from the passage that following Jesus is truly costly. Jesus knew that putting\nHim first before family and possession is a difficult task; perhaps for the rich, thus He\nrepeatedly emphasised the need to count the cost. He illustrated this when He made the\nstatement: \u201cFor which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the\ncost, whether he has enough to complete...?\u201d The early followers of Jesus were equipped with\nthis truth. They were ready to follow Jesus, despite the challenges and persecution they faced,\neven when He was not physically with them. They demonstrated their undying passion for the\nministry to the end without compromising their faith.

It\nwas primarily told to show the Pharisees of Jesus\\' days, and by extension contemporary\nbelievers, that we are all sinners in need of God\\'s mercy. Obviously, the father in this parable\nrepresents God who shows mercy to sinners while the prodigal son symbolises lost sinners.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Son\\'s Unjustified Request Luke 15:11-13<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus often spoke in parables either to teach a lesson or describe the nature of the kingdom\nof heaven. In this chapter, He told the parables of the lost sheep, coin and the prodigal son.\nThe parable of the prodigal son opens with the younger son\\'s request to have his share of\nhis father\\'s estate, which was unusual because his father was still alive. Although according\nto the Jewish culture, the younger brother is entitled to receive half of what his elder\nbrother would receive (Deuteronomy 21:17), but the request made by the young man was\nuncalled-for because in the same Jewish context a father should not divide his estate while\nhe is still alive. More so, the boy was probably still single and so his demand was premature.\nNevertheless, the request was granted and the father divided his property between his two\nsons. According to verse 13, the young man demonstrated his immaturity, leaving home to\na far country where he wasted all he got from his father on reckless living.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>From all indications, the inordinate action of the young man to get his portion of his\nfather\\'s property is clear. He wanted to be free and continue to enjoy life without much\nlabour. His father, on the other hand, gave him freedom to determine his choice of life,\neven though he knew the action was strictly against the custom of the Jews. It is probable\nhis father knew the son would waste his inheritance, yet he also knew that only through\nthe free exercise of choice can the decision to return home be made. From that day, the son became independent and not long after, he travelled to a distant country only to\nwaste the whole resources on reckless living. The major challenge in this lesson is that\nChristian parents should prayerfully guide their children, especially in making choices\nand be strict where necessary. This is important because every wrong decision has its\nown consequences that will eventually affect the whole family and the future of such\nchildren.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss some signs of prodigal living today that does not glorify God.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Based on today\\'s lesson, to what extent should parents influence the choices their\nchildren make?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Son\\'s Justified Suffering Luke 15:14-16<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The motive of the younger son who demanded for his own portion of his father\\'s\nproperty became plain when he left for an unknown destination with all the property.\nAccording to verse 14, he lived a riotous life and spent everything he had without any\nreserve. Unfortunately, there was severe famine throughout the country and the young\nman had nothing to live on. The only means of survival was to work in a piggery that\nbelonged to one of the citizens of the country. Ironically, Jews do not keep pigs because it\nbelongs to a group of animals classified as unclean (Deuteronomy 14:8). This is one of the\nconsequences of wasteful living. It can also lead to isolation, starvation, rejection and\nfrustration, as seen in the life of the young man. Even though the job provided an\nopportunity for him to live by the remnant of the feed from the pigs, he was, however,\ndissatisfied with the work. It is probable that whenever he remembered his life under the\ntutelage of his father with enough to eat and drink in comparison with his suffering in a\nforeign land, he would be sorrowful.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Someone once said, \u201cFor every action, there is always a corresponding consequence\nwhether positive or negative.\u201d This was the case of the young man who lived an unguided\nreckless life and was forced by circumstances to accept the dirtiest and most socially\nunacceptable work to the Jews.

Verse 17 says, \u201cWhen he came to his senses, he said,\n\\'How many of my father\\'s hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to\ndeath!\\'\u201d He decided to go back to his father with the following proposals:<ol>\n<li>To confess his sins of disobedience against heaven and his father.<\/li>\n<li>His unworthiness to be called a son.<\/li>\n<li>To ask his father to regard him as one of his servants because he had lost the\nprivilege of being a son.<\/li>\n<\/ol>The young man\\'s confession in verse 17 suggests he came to the point of godly sorrow,\nwhich is the first step in the process of repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10). He was\nconvinced he had done something wrong. He even concluded he had sinned against\nheaven and his father and was ready to confess and seek for restoration (15:18).\nInterestingly, while he was still afar off, his father who probably had longed to see him\nwas filled with compassion. He ran to him, threw his arms around him and kissed him. His\nreturn was celebrated by putting on him a ring, robe and sandals as signs of authority\nand position in the family. His father said, \u201cFor this son of mine was dead and is alive\nagain; he was lost and is found. So they began to celebrate.\u201d (v. 25)\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The parable simply demonstrates God\\'s welcoming attitude to receive sinners who\ncome to Him in repentance like the prodigal son. We can see from the lesson that the\nfather did not go in search of the lost son, but he came back on his own having realised\nhis sinful acts. It is, therefore, worth mentioning that the mercy of God for sinners is\ndependent on our confession, repentance and willingness to return to Him. More so,\nChristians should understand the fact that God\\'s love is all-embracing, unconditional\nand seems to overflow for repentant sinners. Consequently, like the prodigal son, we all\nhave been lost in sin because of the Adamic nature and have wandered away but\nthrough the love of God, expressed in Christ Jesus, we have been brought closer to share\nin the inheritance of the saints in light (Colossians 1:11-14). We should, therefore, make\nconscious efforts to return to God. He is always waiting with an open arm to receive and\nrestore us to Himself; like the father who received his son unreservedly.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What are the signs of true repentance?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss why this parable is important to Jesus and the lessons it teaches about God\\'s\nattitude towards sinners.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Help me, Lord, to avoid every lifestyle that does not glorify You.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Lord, do not allow me to be comfortable with sinful behaviour.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>I confess all my sins Lord, forgive and restore me to Yourself.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 3-->\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Let class members make a deliberate effort to locate a backslidden member of the\nchurch with the aim of restoring him\/her by applying today\\'s lesson.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Believers should offer Christlike forgiveness and acceptance to those who repent of\ntheir sins.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Repentance is the key to a restored relationship with God who loves sinners.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Believers should treasure relationship above money.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>We should be concerned about those who have backslide and rejoice when they\nreturn to the faith.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>God loves sinners but hates their sinful lifestyle.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>We should all labour to bring new converts into the fold.<\/li>\n\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":12,"title":"calling to salvation","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4> March 24, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>CALLING TO SALVATION<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:1 Chronicles 16:8-13, 23-27<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Luke 19:1-10<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>For the Son of man came to seek and to save\nwhat was lost.<b>Luke 19:10<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Mention some steps Christians can\ntake in order to know more about\nChrist.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Make a decision for restitution, as one of\nthe processes of repentance, where\nnecessary.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Express how God has shown His love to\nthem without deserving it.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Every year, \u201cGod\\'s People Baptist Conference\u201d organises a revival programme that Eusually attracts people from within and outside the Conference. Last year, the\nturnout was so amazing that the organising committee suggested using a\nstadium. Indeed, it was a huge success with many miracles, signs and wonders. The last\nday of the programme was usually set aside for people to testify to the goodness of God\nin their lives. On that particular day, an elderly woman came out with excitement, singing\nas tears of joy rolled down her cheeks. According to her testimony, she had found\nsalvation and, therefore, she was saved from eternal destruction. When interviewed by\njournalists about the source of her joy, she simply said, \u201cThis is the best thing that will\never happened to me. I am saved. I have peace in my heart.\u201d However, while some\npeople ignored her testimony and considered it irrelevant, others joined her to praise\nGod because they knew the value of salvation that had been extended to the woman\n(Romans 8:1).<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The story of Zacchaeus\\' encounter with Jesus is only recorded by Luke. It indicates\nJesus\\' interest in people, particularly those who were despised by the religious leaders.\nHe was a chief tax collector for the Roman Government and the head of a large office of\ntax collectors. Generally, people hated tax collectors in his days; in fact they were often\ndespised by the Jews because they inflated taxes in order to enrich themselves.\nHowever, today\\'s lesson x-rays Zacchaeus and his effort to see Jesus and how it brought\nhim salvation alongside his family members. He expressed joy and made restitution in\nresponse to the gift of salvation.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Desperate Search for Salvation Luke 19:1-5<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus was only about twenty-five kilometers (25km, i.e. 15 miles) away from Jerusalem\n where He performed the last of His public miracles the healing of a blind man (Luke\n18:35-43). As He continued His journey and went through Jericho, there was a rich chief\ntax collector named Zacchaeus. He was a man of high status in his own community.\nAccording to verse 3, every effort Zacchaeus made to see Jesus was unsuccessful\nbecause of his small stature and the crowd that followed Jesus. However, he did not\nrelent; out of desperation, he devised another means as he ran ahead and climbed a\nsycamore tree along Jesus\\' route. Amazingly, when Jesus got to the place, He looked up\nand said to Zacchaeus, \u201cHurry down Zacchaeus, because I must stay in your house today.\u201d\n(v. 5, GNB) The testimony is that, the seeker eventually became the sought. Because\nJesus is omniscient, He knew Zacchaeus\\' intention to see Him and, therefore, singled him\nout amidst the crowd.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The name \\'Zacchaeus\\' literally means \\'righteous\\' or \\'clean.\\' In his days, tax collectors\nwere regarded as collaborators with the Roman government, and therefore were treated as Gentiles. But despite the fact that he was regarded as a sinner because of the\nnature of his profession (they were always accused of extortion) as a tax collector, he was\nextraordinarily anxious to see Jesus and he eventually saw Him and even hosted Him in\nhis house. We now live in an era when people work round the clock in order to increase\ntheir knowledge either academically or technologically without any effort to know more\nabout Jesus who is the Author and Finisher of our faith. Christians should remember that\nthe ultimate plan of God is that all humankind should come to the knowledge of\nsalvation, even the worst of sinners (Isaiah 1:18). This can be done when we study our\nBibles every day, seek His face and are engaged in other spiritual disciplines. Our\nultimate desire should be to see Jesus like Zacchaeus who, despite his stature and the\ncrowd, climbed a tree in order to see Jesus. At last, Jesus found him. His determination to\nsee Jesus should serve as a lesson to us as we seek to know and relate with Jesus more\nintimately from day-to-day.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What exactly was the driving force behind Zacchaeus\\' search for Jesus?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss how some major hindrances to the salvation of sinners today can be handled.\nAlso, share some hindrances that prevent believers from knowing Christ more and\nhow to overcome them.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Zacchaeus Receives Salvation Luke 19:6-10<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus\\' invitation to Zacchaeus was such that he could not resist. Immediately Jesus\ncommanded him, he hurriedly came down from the tree and welcomed Him with great\njoy into his home. The people who had witnessed the event murmured to one another\nsaying, \u201cThis man has gone as a guest to the home of a sinner!\u201d (v. 7, GNB) Unlike the\nyoung ruler who was not ready to give out his possessions because he was wealthy (Luke\n18:23), Zacchaeus was willing to part with his. As a proof to his testimony (v. 8), he\nvoluntarily declared to take up the social responsibility of his neighbours. He said, \u201cI will\ngive half of my wealth to the poor and restore fourfold any money to any person I have\ncheated.\u201d (v. 8b) By so doing, he went beyond what the Law of Moses required as far as\nrestitution is concerned (Leviticus 6:1-5). However, it should be noted that Zacchaeus\\'\ndecision to give was only a response to Jesus\\' love and not merely a moral act of doing\nthe right thing.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Ultimately, Zacchaeus\\' action pleased Jesus.

Little wonder when Levi held a feast for\nJesus in his home with some tax collectors, some Pharisees and teachers of the Law\ncomplained about their action and accused Jesus\\' disciples of eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners. However, Jesus replied that He has come to call the outcasts\n(Luke 5:29-32).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n<p>Jesus chose to abide with Zacchaeus, a tax collector rather than a priest or Jewish leader. His\npresence made a great difference in the life of the family of Zacchaeus. From a political\nperspective, Zacchaeus was transformed from being a puppet of the Roman regime to a real\ndescendant of Abraham. By implication, Zacchaeus lived up to his name \\'clean\\' or \\'righteous\\'\nbecause he was justified and became a new man in Christ. He saw Jesus as the true riches rather\nthan his accumulated material things. This motivated him to willingly relinquish in fourfolds all\nhe had wrongfully acquired.

By so doing, He modelled a\nperfect example of leadership that remains matchless in the history of humankind. This is\nclear in the way He called His first four disciples. Although they were ordinary fishermen\nwithout any formal training, eventually they became trustworthy pillars of the early\nchurch. They did great exploits because they were taught the principle of discipleship so\nmuch that even when Jesus was no longer physically with them, they continued in the\nministry, in spite of severe persecution.

When He heard of John\\'s imprisonment, He returned to Galilee, and\nfinally settled in Capernaum. It is important to note that this region was the area occupied\nby the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, after the conquest of Joshua\\'s time. Jesus did most\nof His public ministry in these areas (Zebulun and Naphtali), which is the north and west of\nthe Sea of Galilee. Indeed, Jesus lived in fulfilment of Isaiah\\'s prophecy that He would be a\nlight to the Gentiles and bring salvation to the ends of the earth (Isaiah 9:1-2). So, Jesus\ncame in fulfilment of this age-long prophecy as Light that dispelled darkness.\nSubsequently, He made known the priority of discipleship and began to preach His\nmessage about repentance and the nearness of the kingdom of heaven (v. 17).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus\\' ministry centred on discipleship and a call to embrace Him. He is the\nembodiment of God\\'s light that dispels the darkness of this world (John 8:12). The only\nway we can embrace this light is through repentance, which characterised John the\nBaptist\\'s earlier message and Jesus\\' latter instructions on what His disciples were to\nproclaim. Repentance is crucial in becoming a member of God\\'s family and it is a\nprerequisite to embrace the light of salvation, which is Christ. This is the first step in the\ndiscipleship process. Therefore, for anyone who wants to follow Christ, repentance must\nfirst take place; a complete change of mind to embrace righteousness without any regret\n(2 Corinthians 7:10). It is upon this act of initial and continual repentance that\ndiscipleship is premised.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Describe the nature of true repentance and why it is difficult<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What is the place of repentance in becoming a member of God\\'s family and to keep\nbecoming like Christ?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Purpose of Discipleship Matthew 4:18-20<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The Bible stated categorically Jesus\\' mission of coming to the world. He came to save His people\n from their sin (Matthew 1:21; Luke 19:10) this was the good news He proclaimed throughout\nHis earthly ministry. In order to fulfil this mission, He called some disciples to be His followers\nwhom He could train for the work of the kingdom. As He walked along the shore of the Sea of\nGalilee, He saw two brothers, who were professional fishermen, Simon also known as Peter and\nAndrew; catching fish. He said to them, \u201cCome, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d In\nother words, they were to become partners in the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom of\n heaven the reason for which He was born. By this singular statement, Jesus revealed to them\nthe purpose of calling them. The Scripture says that straight away, they left their nets and\nfollowed Him (v. 20), leaving their business and means of livelihood without much knowledge on\nthe nature of the ministry. This is in contrast with some people today who find it difficult to\nrespond to the call into the discipleship process of living the life of Christ in their workplace and\neventually going into ministry.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The passage clearly reveals the purpose of discipleship and the reason for which the\ndisciples were called. They were called to continuously follow Jesus, learn His ways and\nproclaim the message of the kingdom of heaven and bring humankind to Christ. Following\nJesus demands self-denial for the cause of the kingdom. It is a process that enables the\nfollowers of Christ to develop godly virtues that are required to win others to the kingdom. It is\nworth mentioning that the early disciples fulfilled the purpose and process of discipleship as\nthey were able to testify that, \u201cas for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and\nheard\u201d (Acts 4:20). This was the result of their prompt and faithful response to Jesus\\' invitation\nas stated in Matthew 4:20. Unfortunately today, many people want to come to Christ but they\nare not ready to follow His teachings and principles. The principles of Christ must be embraced\nby His disciples so that we can live the life of the kingdom and share same with others.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What should be the role of the church in helping believers fulfil the purpose of\ndiscipleship?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What are the benefits of character transformation of believers in both personal and\ncorporate evangelism?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Price of Discipleship Matthew 4:21-22<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>As Jesus continued to call people to partner with Him in kingdom business, He made\nknown three important things: the priority, purpose and the price of following Him.\nAccording to this text, He also saw two brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee.They were in a boat with their father mending their nets, getting ready for the day\\'s\nbusiness as fishermen. The Bible says that when Jesus called them, they immediately left\nthe boat and their father and followed Him. Their response was prompt just like the case\nof Peter and Andrew. The implication is that following Christ may demand that we\nforsake something we really like, change our job or attitude at work; if it is not fitting for a\ndisciple of Jesus Christ. Also, we may experience a temporary itch with family members\nand loved ones who are not disciples of Christ. However, whatever form it takes, there is\nalways a price to pay for following Jesus.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Discipleship is a process; and not just a church programme that must be completed within\na stipulated time. In other words, it is a daily walk with Christ, which demands living for Him,\nno matter the circumstance like the disciples of the early church. Although they were greatly\npersecuted, yet their understanding of the price of discipleship kept them going and so, they\nwere rewarded. However, we should know that while God rewards faithful service, our\nprimary motivation for following Christ should not be material gains but to seek first the\nkingdom of God and His righteousness, and all other things will be given to us as well\n(Matthew 6:33). We should be ready to emulate missionaries like J. T. Bowen, an American\nmissionary who brought the Baptist faith to Nigeria.

When Jesus saw the crowd, He underscored the\nenormity of the harvest, and the insufficiency of workers (Matthew 9:37). After that, He\nprayed that the Lord would send more workers into His harvest. Matthew chapter 10\nstarted with what looked like a response to the great harvest that Jesus had earlier\nidentified. He summoned them (the twelve apostles, v. 2) whom He had earlier called to\nfollow Him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and\nsickness.

When Jesus called the disciples for the kingdom task, He made adequate\nprovision for their success. They were sent out with enough instructions as contained in\nverses 7-8. He said to them:<ol>\n<li>Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans but go to the lost sheep\nof Israel. However, this does not mean that Jesus excluded other nations from the gift of\nsalvation. Rather, this was a specific mission to a specific people (the Jews) who were the\nprimary recipients of God\\'s grace of salvation (Romans 1:16). So, it does not negate the\ntruth that all, whether Jews or Gentiles in the New Testament have equal right to the\nGospel.<\/li>\n<li>Preach a specific message that \\'The kingdom of heaven is near.\\' This same message\nwas preached by John the Baptist to those who came to hear him (Matthew 3:1-2), as\nwell as Jesus when He began to preach at the beginning of His public ministry\n(Matthew 4:17).<\/li>\n<li>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, and drive out demons.\nMore importantly, Jesus added that freely they had received and so, they must give\nfreely (v. 8b) or minister to the people free of charge.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>These instructions can also guide us today as we spread the good news throughout the\nworld (Matthew 28:19-20).

It means that their needs will be provided for by the people\nwhom they will be living with. He concluded and assured them that on the judgment day,\nGod would be more merciful to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah who were\ncondemned for their lack of hospitality (Ezekiel 16:47), and their rejection of God\\'s\nmessengers and message (Genesis 19). The shaking off of the dust of one\\'s feet was an\nact of warning against those cities that would reject the message of salvation (v. 14).

When He had\nfinished these things (v. 1), He said to the disciples, \u201cAs you know, the Passover is two\n days away and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified\u201d as He had earlier\npredicted on His way to Jerusalem (Matthew 16:21-22;20:17-19). The reminder of His\ncrucifixion became necessary because the disciples may have had the impression that\nJesus, as the Messiah, would never experience the suffering He had always told them\nawaited Him. As a confirmation to the predictions, the chief priests, scribes, and elders\nof the people were seen assembled together in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest\nand \u201cthey plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill Him.\u201d (v. 4) However, they were\nvery careful not to cause uproar among the people by His arrest because it was during\nthe Passover Feast (v. 5). Ironically, though they resolved not to kill Jesus during the\nPassover Feast, it was exactly during the Passover that Jesus was crucified. This was an\nindication that they were not the ones in control of the time appointed for Jesus\\' death;\nGod had already set the time.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus\\' crucifixion during the Passover was symbolic. It was the confirmation that He is\nthe real Passover Lamb. The chief priests, scribes and elders of the people were the\ncustodians of the Law who should understand God\\'s mind about Jesus as foretold long ago.\nBut they were blinded by religion, and their hearts were darkened because they lacked the\nknowledge of God. As a result, they chose their doomed part in the entire plan of God for\nthe salvation of humankind. They thought they were doing Jesus harm; little did they know that they were only working towards fulfilling His ultimate destiny on earth. Believers\nshould see beyond mere religiosity and seek to understand God\\'s plan for their lives.

Some Bible scholars suggest it may\nhave been Simon who was healed by Jesus, because it is not possible for a leper to live\namong the people. The appellation, the leper, may have been retained because it was\nneeded to distinguish him from other Simons. As Jesus reclined at the table, a woman\n(identified as Mary, sister of Lazarus in John 12:3) came with an alabaster jar of\nexpensive perfume, and poured it on His head. Obviously, the woman\\'s gesture was\nborne out of her profound love and devotion to the Master. By breaking her alabaster jar\nof spikenard oil (Mark 14:3), she expressed her heartfelt sacrificial love for Jesus without\nconsidering its cost. According to verse 8, the worth of the perfume attracted the\nattention of the disciples and they became aggrieved. They asked, \u201cWhy this waste?\u201d\nTheir concern was that the perfume, which was worth a year\\'s wage, three hundred\ndenarii (Mark 14:5; John12:5) \u201c... could have been sold at a high price and the money\ngiven to the poor\u201d (v. 9). In essence, the woman was considered a waster who\nsquandered what could have been given to the poor on Jesus alone. According to John\\'s\naccount, Judas Iscariot was identified as the one who opposed the woman\\'s action, not\nbecause he really cared for the poor, but because he kept the purse, and had always\nstolen from it (John 12:4-6).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Obviously, the woman must have received Jesus\\' unconditional love for her to be able\nto give so much without holding back. She must have considered the immeasurable love\nshe had received from the Lord Jesus, and concluded that nothing is too big to withhold\nfrom the One who had given her so much. Although the disciples of Jesus considered it a\nwaste, but her action was meant simply to honour Jesus. Eventually, her generosity\nguaranteed her undying fame as stated in verse 12.

However, it\nshould be noted that Jesus did not undermine the importance of caring for the poor. He only\nmeant that anointing Him with an expensive perfume at that time was to honour Him before\nHis death. Although the woman may not have known the importance of what she did; Jesus\nsaw it as preparation for His burial. It is customary in ancient Israel to anoint the body of the\ndead with spices, in order to preserve it from decay. In place of condemnation, Jesus\ncommended the woman and said in verse 13: \u201cI tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is\npreached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\u201d By this,\nJesus imprinted the memory of the woman in history, such that there is no way you will tell the\nstory of Jesus\\' life and ministry without making reference to this woman\\'s generosity.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The service that attracts God\\'s attention and blessing is that which is done without holding\nanything back. The fact that the woman broke her alabaster box of expensive perfume for the\npurpose of anointing Jesus is an indication that she was ready to give her all. The kind of\nworship and sacrifice that please God is that which is whole. Many believers struggle to do\nthings that will make people remember them when they are gone, but this woman\\'s story\n  teaches us that the true way to become unforgettable to leave an everlasting memorial\nis to give sacrificially to God.

Though many skeptics, philosophers and free thinkers have tried to\n\nexplain it away through different theories, the fact of Jesus\\' resurrection cannot\n\njust be discountenanced. Sir William M. Ramsay, one of the foremost geographers of the\n\n19th century was also an antagonist of Christianity. After many years of research, he\n\nbecame firmly convinced of the accuracy of the New Testament, Christ\\'s death and\n\nresurrection, and then reversed his antagonism against Christianity. Similarly, Richard\n\nDawkins, an evolutionary biologist and renowned atheist, who though has refused to\n\nchange his views about God, was one of the nearly a thousand scientists who gathered at\n\na conference to review their study on the resurrection of Christ. At last, Dawkins said,\n\n\u201cThere is no reasonable doubt, this resurrection of a first-century Jewish sage or prophet\n\nor what you have named Jesus is an historical fact.\u201d<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n<p>Unarguably, the Bible, not science, is the basis for the truth of Jesus\\' resurrection. But\n\nwe can deduce from the scientific discoveries that the story of Jesus\\' resurrection is not just\n\na fable but a real story, which though happened many centuries ago, is forever true. The\n\nfour gospels differ in some details about the events of Jesus\\' life and ministry they\n\nrecorded, the resurrection inclusive, but all of them agree on one thing \u2013 Jesus died and\n\nresurrected on the third day. In today\\'s lesson, we shall examine Jesus\\' resurrection, a\n\npassionate search for Him and the spread of the good news.<\/p>\n\n\n     \n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>Passionate Search and Unexpected Discovery Matthew 28:1-7<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The resurrection account of Jesus is recorded differently by the four gospels according to\n\nthe information available to them. According to Matthew\\'s account, at the break of dawn\n\nimmediately after the Sabbath, on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the\n\nother Mary went to the tomb where Jesus\\' body was laid. Without doubt, their purpose\n\nwas to anoint Him, this they could not do the previous day because of the Sabbath (Mark\n\n16:1; Luke 24:1). These women had followed Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem and so they\n\nhad witnessed His death and how His body was laid. Little wonder they could easily locate\n\nthe tomb. According to verse 2, there was a violent earthquake and the angel of the Lord\n\ndescended from heaven. He rolled away the stone at the entrance of the tomb and sat on\n\nit. His appearance made the guards afraid and they became like dead men. Even though\n\nthey were fully armed, they could not withstand the move of God to raise Jesus from the\n\ndead. Interestingly, the angel succeeded in dousing the fear of the women with the proof\n\nof His resurrection. He said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for\n\nJesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the\n\nplace where he lay.\u201d (Matthew 28:5-6) Earlier on, Jesus had promised to go to Galilee after His resurrection. In accordance to this promise, the angel commanded the women\n\nto go to Galilee and tell the good news to His disciples.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The central truth in this passage is that the women actually made a passionate search\n\nand eventually made an unexpected discovery. The commitment and risk of going to the\n\ntomb early on the resurrection morning purposely to anoint the body of Jesus is highly\n\ncommendable. In their search for Jesus, they became the first among others who\n\nproclaimed the news of the resurrection message. Their passion and love for Jesus was\n\ndemonstrated by their actions. So, they became firsthand witnesses of the resurrection\n\naccount. Having encountered the resurrected Lord, believers are to proclaim the good\n\nnews to others who are yet to know. As the angel told the women (v. 7), we all should\n\nconsider preaching the Gospel a matter that demands urgency, and give the attention,\n\npassion, and commitment that it deserves.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 2-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>What inspiration can contemporary believers draw from the proofs of the\n\nresurrection of Jesus?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>Discuss the passion of the women in the resurrection event.

They left the\n\ntomb immediately and took the message to the disciples. Though with mixed feelings\n\nbecause they were still afraid, yet they were filled with the joy of the resurrection story.\n\nSuddenly, Jesus met them and said, \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d Quickly, they came to Him, took\n\nhold of His feet, and worshipped Him (v. 9). In other words, they recognised Him and they\n\nwere quick enough to worship Him. Again, Jesus calmed their fears and ordered them to\n\ngo and tell His brothers (disciples) to go to Galilee, and there they would see Him.\n\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Though the women\\'s visit to the tomb was for a different mission, their faith in Jesus\n\nwas strengthened by the resurrection event and they immediately believed it. They\n\nquickly ran out of the tomb to break the news to Jesus\\' disciples with fear and joy at the\n\nsame time (v. 8). Jesus\\' words to them, \u201cDo not be afraid\u201d converted their fears to\n\ncourage, and they became bearers of the good news of Jesus\\' resurrection. Of course,\n\nthis is another proof of the reality of His resurrection. The message of the Gospel \u2013 death,\n\nburial and resurrection of Jesus Christ is good news that should be spread abroad so that\n\nmany who have not heard will hear and believe the Gospel. The message should be that\n\nJesus died, and resurrected from the dead and He lives forever more (2 Timothy 2:8).\n\nWhosoever believes this message will not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16b).<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Compare the fear that the women had when they first reached the tomb (v. 5) and the\n\ncourage they had after confirming the resurrection (v. 8).

Immediately, they left the tomb and went into\n\ntown and reported what had happened to the chief priests. Sadly, the chief priests and\n\nthe elders conspired and gave money to them so that they would give false report that\n\nthe disciples came at night to steal Jesus\\' body (vv. 11-13). The guards accepted the\n\nmoney and agreed to spread this lie, in order to avoid the governor\\'s wrath (v. 14). This\n\nwas reported among the Jews till today (v. 15). However, the so-called \\'stolen body\\' story\n\ninvented by the chief priests and elders is self-refuting for the following reasons:<ol>\n\n<li>If the guards were asleep, how would they know it was the disciples who stole the\n\nbody?

This principle has motivated some churches and\nfellowships to be committed to the task of the Great Commission.

However, we should note that this command\nwas not only for the disciples but for all believers.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Jesus Appears to the Disciples Matthew 28:16-17<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>One of the evidences of Jesus\\' resurrection is His appearance to His disciples at different\noccasions. He had earlier commanded His disciples to go to Galilee, where they would\nsee Him (28:10). According to the passage, the eleven disciples and some others\n(without Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus) went to Galilee, to the mountain as they had\nbeen instructed (v. 16). Verse 17 says that when they saw Jesus, they worshipped Him,\neven though some of them surprisingly doubted whether He was really Jesus. Two things\nare notable in this passage:<ol>\n<li>The obedience demonstrated by the disciples to Jesus\\' instruction. It indicates the\nlevel of their faith. Even though they initially doubted His resurrection, they later\nbelieved when they saw Him.<\/li>\n<li>They worshipped Him. When the disciples acknowledged Jesus\\' greatness, they\nresponded by worshipping Him. Their worship was a sign of honour, borne out of\nfaith in Him and acceptance of His lordship over them. This was, however, possible\nbecause the resurrection story had given them a new awareness about the\npersonality and divinity of Jesus. However, the Scripture affirms that some of them\nstill doubted (v. 17), probably because of their joy or the amazement whether it\ncould be true as Luke recorded \u201cAnd while they still did not believe it because of their\njoy and amazement....\u201d Even today, some people are still in doubt about Jesus\\'\nresurrection, despite the evidences.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why would some of the disciples doubt Jesus, having seen Him face to face after His\nresurrection?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What feeling or response should we have when we recall the resurrection of Jesus\nChrist?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Jesus Commissions the Disciples Matthew 28:18-20<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The encounter between the resurrected Lord and His disciples is fantastic. He did not fail\nto make known to them the nature and demand of the ministry, despite the fact that\nsome of them initially doubted the resurrection story. He drew near and said to them,\n\u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (v. 18) He finally\ncommissioned them to continue the work of ministry when He commanded them to go.\nThey were to make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and\nof the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything He had\ncommanded them (v. 20). The command was with a promise that He would be with them\nto the end. This was the climax of Jesus\\' earthly ministry before He ascended to heaven.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The primary duty of the church is to witness to unbelievers and then make them\n members of God\\'s family. This is the assignment each of us has been given to preach,\nteach, and baptise those that have been won to the kingdom of God. Amazingly, Jesus has\nassured us of His presence always. Unfortunately, it appears the church has already lost\nfocus of the Great Commission. Some churches are more concerned about the\nacquisition of landed properties and their money making ventures to the detriment of\nthis divine mandate of soul winning. In fact, the church needs to re-examine her priorities\ntoday, and see whether they are not falling short of Christ\\'s commission. We can see from\nthe passage how Jesus bequeathed His authority to the disciples and commissioned\nthem to go and make other disciples for the expansion of the kingdom of God.

Even after Jesus\\' resurrection, the disciples were still not persuaded that\nthe Messiah\\'s reign is not a temporal one. So, when the apostles had the opportunity to\ndiscuss with Jesus, they inquired about the restoration of the kingdom back to Israel. Jesus\\' response was the complete opposite of the answer they expected. Although He did not\nrebuke them for their enquiry, He declared that the times or dates had been set by the Father\nin His own authority. What was more important to Jesus was how the gospel message would\nbe preached throughout the world. Therefore, He said to them, \u201cBut you will received power\nwhen the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea\nand Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\u201d (v. 8) In other words, when they receive the power\nof the Holy Spirit, they would be witnesses of His resurrection in Jerusalem, Judea and\nSamaria, and to the ends of the earth.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The role of the Holy Spirit in evangelism cannot be over-emphasised. The Holy Spirit is\nthe power of God without whom the work of evangelism will become a real struggle.\nAnd because Jesus knew the enormity of the task ahead of the disciples, He promised to\nsend the Holy Spirit to them so they could be better equipped. Believers today do not\nneed to debate any longer about the person and work of the Holy Spirit.

Thereafter, he emphasised God\\'s gift of\nsalvation, which has put us right with Him (justification). Therefore, our response of faith\nin the Lord Jesus Christ and not mere adherence to the law as claimed by some\ndetermines our salvation.

In his attempt to address the different views,\nhe wrote that both Jews and the Gentiles are unrighteous, explaining that Jesus Christ is\nthe only Way to salvation. He explained further in verse 21 that God\\'s way of putting\npeople right with Him has been made known to them, which the law and the prophets\nhad testified. He made it clear that the only basis by which people are put right with God\nis their faith in Jesus Christ.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The Bible makes it clear in verses 22 and 23 that there is no distinction between Jews\nand Gentiles because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. In other words,\nthey are all sinners in need of God\\'s forgiveness. Paul added that by virtue of the free gift of\nthe grace of God, they have been justified and put right with God through the redemption\nthat came through Jesus Christ. God freely offered Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement so that\nHis blood will become a means through which people will receive forgiveness for their sin\nthrough faith in Him. God\\'s justification of anyone who believes in Jesus was simply a\ndemonstration of His act of righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>Paul had earlier made it clear that the Jews\\' adherence to the Law was not the same\nas being righteous; hence, accusing the Gentiles of unrighteousness was wrong. It is\nimpossible to be righteous by keeping the Law alone. It is the cross of Christ that laid the\nfoundation for the principle of justification. Although all have sinned and are guilty but anyone who accepts Jesus Christ as His Saviour and Lord is declared \"not guilty\" but\n\"righteous\". More importantly, the blood of Jesus guarantees our redemption through\nour faith in Jesus who died as a ransom for humankind. Though, in the Old Testament\ntimes the blood of animals was used to atone for the sin of men (Exodus 12-15); now\nhumankind is justified through the sacrificial death of Christ. This was made possible\nbecause of Jesus\\' humility and obedience to God. Therefore, we are redeemed because\nof the sacrifice Jesus made, and for that, humankind have been declared not guilty but\nrighteous (Ephesians 1:7).<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the negative impact of sin in the life of individuals and the\nnation.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the implication of \u201call have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d for\nbelievers (verse 23).<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>How can believers subdue the power of sin and live in newness of\nlife?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The God of All Romans 3:27-31<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The Jews were known to be strict in the observance of the Law and they became proud of it.\nLittle wonder the Pharisee who went to the temple to pray in Luke 18:9-12, mentioned his\nability to keep the Law in his prayer. However, Paul described the nature of God and\nconfirmed that He is for both the Jews and Gentiles. In verses 29 he said, \"Is God the God of\nthe Jews only? Is he not God of the Gentiles too...?\" Supposedly, if God were the God of the\nJews only, then observing the Law of Moses would have been a condition for putting\npeople right with God and becoming members of His family, but because salvation is a gift\nfrom God; it is for the Gentiles also. Therefore, the Jews have no reason to boast simply\nbecause they obey the Law. Paul concluded and affirmed that one can only be put right\nwith God through faith and not by obeying what the Law of Moses commands (v. 28). After\nall, according to verse 30, there is only one God and He will judge both the Jews and\nGentiles on the basis of their faith.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s explanation is based on the fact that even though God originally made a\ncovenant with the Jews, the Gentiles are also included because they too are the seed of\nAbraham. Therefore, the covenant has been extended to them (Genesis 12:2). This\nimplies that no good work can reconcile humankind to God except through faith in the\npower and blood of Jesus. Paul also maintained that Law has its own benefits, so it\nshould not be nullified because we have faith.

So, once a year, all the young ladies who live\noutside the community usually travel home for the special occasion.

Although the ceremony was characterised by\nmerry-making, Sister Joy never believed in the rite because of her faith in Jesus Christ\nand understanding of God\\'s Word. Despite the effort of her parents to persuade her to\npartake in the ceremony in order to avoid the consequences of delayed marriage and\nbarrenness, she did not yield. Her response was: \u201cTherefore, there is now no\ncondemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the Law of\nthe Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.\u201d (Romans 8:1-2) This, of course,\nis the assurance of a life controlled by the Spirit of God.

Also, in this chapter, he emphasised life in the Spirit that\nsets free from the law of sin and death. Today\\'s lesson focuses on the difference between\nlife in the sinful nature, which results to death and life in accordance with the Spirit,\nwhich results to eternal life.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Law of the Spirit of Life Romans 8:1-4<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>As far as the keeping of the Law is concerned, Paul had earlier written to the brethren in\nRome that the Law itself is not sinful because of its benefits (Romans 7:7). But in chapter\n8, he focused on life in the Spirit in order to make them see the things they are missing by\nholding on to the Law. This was followed by his declaration in verse 1 that there is no\nmore condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus because they have been set free\nfrom the spirit of death and sin through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. The word\n\"Therefore\" at the beginning of this chapter suggests that Apostle Paul had dwelt\nextensively on the issue of keeping the Law in the previous chapter. According to verse 3,\nwhat the Law could not do because of the weakness of human nature, God did through\nJesus Christ. He came in human nature and condemned sin. Therefore, the Law has no power over a Christian who has confessed Jesus and forsaken his\/her evil ways. God did\nthis so that the demands of the Law might be fulfilled in those who are controlled by the\nSpirit. Without doubt, such a person has been united with Christ.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The summary of Paul\\'s statement is that the Law cannot give power to overcome sin\nthough it still plays an important role in the life of a believer. It serves as a moral and ethical\nguide when obeyed out of love for God, but it is the Spirit that gives life. Jesus said in\nMatthew 5:17, \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the law or the Prophets; I have\ncome not to abolish them but to fulfil them.\" Life in the Spirit will enable believers to live a\nrighteous life, and such a person will no more be controlled by the sinful nature but by the\npower of the Holy Spirit. This is the reason God sent His Son in human form to show\nbelievers the proper way and enable them to follow the principle of living righteously. By\nthis, no man will find excuse not to live a Spirit-filled life.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss what it means to live in union with Christ as stated in verse 1.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Describe how believers can be set free from the law of sin and death.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Human Nature Versus the Spirit Romans 8:5-8<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Paul, in this passage, made comparison between two different mindsets (the sinful\nnature and the Spirit) and how both work in the life of individuals. According to verse 5, those\nwho are controlled by their sinful nature live to satisfy their nature whereas; those who live in\naccordance with the Spirit gratify the Spirit (v. 5). Paul explains further in verse 6 that\nobedience to the human nature ends in death because it is in opposition to God (v. 7), and\ndoes not submit to the authority of God. Therefore, they cannot please God by doing His will\nalone. On the other hand, those who live by the dictates of the Holy Spirit will set their minds\non the things of the Spirit. They have peace, life and they are acceptable before God.

However, believers\nshould remember that there are consequences for whichever way we choose to live,\nwhether with the sinful mindset that leads to death and total separation from God or the\none controlled by the Spirit that leads to life, peace and fellowship with God.

However, those\nwho have the Spirit have been put right with God, even though their bodies will die as a\nresult of sin. He was specific in verse 11 when he said that if the Spirit that raised Jesus\nfrom death lives in them, the same Spirit would give life to their mortal bodies.\nConsequently, they have an obligation not to live according to their sinful desires\nbecause it results to death. Nevertheless, the Spirit that lives in them will crucify every\nsinful action so that they will have life. His conclusion according to verse 14 is that those\nwho are controlled by the Spirit of God are God\\'s children. Interestingly, such Spirit does\nnot result in enslavement any longer because they have received the Spirit of sonship,\nand by Him we cry, \u201cAbba, Father\u201d.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s assertion in the passage is that if anyone is in Christ then he\/she has the Spirit\nof God living and dwelling in him\/her.

This new relationship between God and His people makes us eligible to\nsay,\"Abba, Father\" and this apparently strengthens the fellowship, especially for those\nwho trust Him.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What are the benefits and privileges of allowing the Spirit of God to dwell in\nus?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the nature of the obligation Paul said Christians have in verse 12.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray that God will help believers to be free from the burden of sins so that we will not\nbe condemned.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray and ask God to help you live according to the power of the Holy Spirit, instead of\nbeing controlled by your sinful nature.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Ask class members to compare and contrast a life controlled by the Spirit of God and\none controlled by human desires.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>State the benefits of allowing the Spirit of God to control one\\'s life.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>The consequence of sin is death and separation from God.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>God is always ready to free us from the burden of sins and condemnation.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Christians should learn to celebrate the freedom of life through Christ Jesus.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>Believers should share the good news of their new life with those seeking to find life\nin the flesh.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>We should struggle against every tendency to satisfy the desires of the flesh.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\nTo be carnally-minded is death.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":20,"title":"the call of the gentiles","message":"<center>\n\n\n            <h4>May 19, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n\n            <h3>THE CALL OF THE GENTILES<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n\n        <div>\n\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Romans 10:5-13<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n\n        <p> Background Scripture:Romans 11<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\n\t\t<p>Lesson Scripture: Romans 11:11-24<\/p>\n\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n\n        \n        <p>Do not boast over those branches.

They were successful in their business career. They were well respected\n\nby their family members, church members and the community because they had\n\nlarge hearts to accommodate people, especially the lowly. The couple adopted indigent\n\nchildren and sponsored their education to University level. They graduated and were\n\nemployed in different establishments and some started their own businesses.\n\nUnfortunately, as committed as they were in helping other children to improve\n\nacademically, their only daughter, Dorcas, was non-chalant towards her studies. She was\n\nwayward, stubborn and had no respect for anyone. She always claimed rights as the only\n\nchild of her parents; bragging that other children in the home were just servants who\n\nwere adopted into the family. Her claim was that she alone is qualified to inherit the\n\nproperty of her parents. Eventually, she became jealous of the other children as they\n\nexcelled in their education.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n<p>The story above can be likened to what happened to the covenant people of Israel,\n\nand the Gentiles. Originally, Israel was in God\\'s plan of salvation but they lost the\n\nopportunity because of their unbelief. However, when the Gentiles embraced the\n\nGospel, the unbelieving Jews became jealous of God\\'s blessing on them. Today\\'s lesson\n\ncentres on the fact that even though the Jews had rejected the gospel message, it did not\n\nmean that God had rejected them outrightly.<\/p>\n\n\n     \n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>God\\'s Grace to the Gentiles Romans 11:11-16<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>In the first few verses of the chapter, Paul described God\\'s mercy on Israel and how He did\n\nnot totally reject them, despite their rebellious acts. However, Paul asked a pertinent\n\nquestion in verse 11. He said, \u201c\u2026did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all!\n\nRather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel\n\nenvious.\u201d (v. 11) As it is seen in verse 12, the sin of the Jews brought riches to the world\n\nwhile their spiritual poverty brought blessings to the Gentiles. Invariably, if their sin could\n\nbring blessings to the Gentiles, the blessings will be greater if the Jews are included.\n\nNevertheless, Paul envisaged the possibility of making His people (the Jews) jealous at\n\nthe salvation of the Gentiles so that some of them will be saved. His claim in verse 15 is\n\nthat if their rejection resulted in the reconciliation of the world to God, then their\n\nacceptance will be more beneficial because it will be life from the dead. According to\n\nPaul\u2019s analogy in verse 16, if the first piece of bread is given to God, then the whole loaf is\n\nHis; just as the whole tree belongs to God if the roots of a tree are given to Him. The Jews continually sinned against God despite the fact that they were God\\'s chosen people. They\n\n abused the grace through disobedience and idolatry deliberate sins\u2019 which is a\n\ndeviation from God\\'s plan and purpose for them. Though God punished and rejected\n\nthem, He will not abandon them forever (Romans 11:11a), and His grace was made\n\nmanifest in several ways. When the Jews rejected the Gospel, Paul decided to extend it to\n\nthe Gentiles and thus salvation came to them (v. 11b); but Israel became envious.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n<p>God\\'s purpose for the world is abundant life (John 10:10; Romans 11:12) and\n\nabundant life in God brings riches to the world. This implies that the Gentiles are now\n\nrich towards God. It should be noted that God is still reconciling people back to Himself\n\n(vv. 13-14). This leads to a new life in Christ, which is equivalent to \"greater riches\" as\n\nstated in verse 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Why did the Israelites continue to sin despite God\\'s faithfulness to\n\nthem?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>Discuss some causes of envy and jealousy among Christians today and how to control\n\nit.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n\n        <\/li> \n\n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>Paul\\'s Necessary Warning Romans 11:17-21<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s warning in this passage was directed to the Gentile Christians whom he addressed\n\nas \u201cthe branch from the olive tree\" because of their acceptance of the message of the\n\nGospel. He made it clear in verse 17 that some branches of the cultivated olive tree,\n\nwhich represents the Jews have been cut off. Consequently, a new branch of a wild olive\n\ntree (Gentiles) has been fixed to it. This implies that both the Jews and Gentiles have the\n\nsame spiritual opportunity. Therefore, he warned the Gentiles in verse 18 against\n\nboasting over the Israelites because they are simply the branch and so, they do not\n\nsupport the root but the root supports them. In other words, the salvation of the Gentile\n\nChristians depends more on the Jews, especially the Patriarchs like Abraham (John 4:22).\n\nEven though the Gentiles assumed that the Jews were broken off to make way for them,\n\nthe truth is that they were broken off because of their unbelief and so, there should be\n\nno room for boasting. Instead, Paul warned them to be careful. According to verse 21, if\n\nGod did not spare the Jews, who are like the natural branches; then He will not spare you\n\n(the Gentiles).\n\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>The passage is characterised by different metaphors with different meanings. As it is\n\nused in the passage, the \u201cbroken branches\u201d, \u201colive tree\u201d and \u201croot\u201d refer to the Israelites\n\n(Jews) while the wild \"olive shoot\" refers to the Gentile Christians. The broken branches represent the Israelites\u2019 unbelief in contrast to the shoot (the Gentiles) that represents\n\nthose who believe in Christ and are \u201cgrafted in\u201d (accepted into the covenant family of\n\nGod). Paul used the metaphor to illustrate the ancient tradition of grafting a slip of wild\n\nolive to give the tree new vigour. God treats everyone He grafts into His family as special\n\nv. 19. However, the privileges enjoyed should not lead to boasting, pride or arrogance (2\n\nCorinthians 10:13); rather, they should acknowledge it as God\\'s mercy.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n\n        <ol>\n\n        \n        <li>Discuss the consequences of unbelief.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n\n        <li>What is the role of the church in making sure that our children continue in the faith\n\nand seek after righteousness?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\n\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n\n        <h5>God\\'s Mercy Emphasized Romans 11:22-24<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s warnings to the brethren in Rome were directed to the Gentiles and Jews alike.\n\nEarlier on, Paul had cautioned the Jews about their pride and presumptions as regards to\n\nobserving the Law of Moses but now, the Gentiles are warned not to take God\\'s kindness\n\nfor granted. Paul further warned that if the Gentiles fail to continue in their faith, they too\n\nwill be cut off and the Jews will be grafted in again, provided they do not continue in their\n\nunbelief. In verse 24, he likened the Gentiles to the branch of a wild olive tree that is cut off\n\nand grafted again to a cultivated olive tree. According to verse 24b, Paul was hopeful and\n\ndefinite about what God can do for the Jews, thus he likened them to a cultivated tree.\n\nTherefore, God will easily graft these broken branches to their tree again. Paul, however,\n\nrecognised the fact that such supernatural grafting or accepting the Gentiles into the family\n\nof God is contrary to nature.\n\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n\n        <p>One of Paul\\'s emphases in the passage is the grafting process for both the Jews and Gentile\n\nChristians based on their faith. Nevertheless, the Jews historically belong to the parent tree;\n\nthus they will much more easily and readily be grafted into their own olive tree. Anyone who\n\nbelieves in God, through Jesus Christ, is automatically grafted in or supernaturally connected\n\nto the family of God. Paul concluded with the affirmation that God can do it.

She continued\nto pray for her neighbour and her family, she even visited and demonstrated her love\nthrough acts of kindness. Eventually, she gave her life to Christ during one of the\ncrusades organised by the Christian Association of Nigerian (CAN) in the community.\nGradually, it was observed that her way of life had changed.

He particularly made a passionate appeal in the two verses to the brethren\nconcerning three important things: to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God;\ndedicate themselves to His service and please God in all they do. In other words, they\nwere expected to live their lives daily as a sacrifice to God with complete devotion, so\nthat God will be satisfied with them. However, the concept of a \"living sacrifice\"as an Old\nTestament practice demands that only healthy animals were killed as sacrifices to God as\npart of true worship. Furthermore, they were admonished not to obey the rules of the\nworld but to have a complete change of mind. Unfortunately, the standard of the world\nhas been introduced to the church in the name of civilisation. To a large extent, this has\naffected the way we dress, greet, relate and conduct ourselves .The Scripture states that\nwhen one is in Christ, old things have passed away and everything has become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).

He admonished\nthem not to think of themselves more highly than others, which sometimes come as a\nresult of pride. Instead, he recommended modesty in their thinking and to judge\nthemselves based on the measure of faith God had given them. Thereafter, he likened\nthe unity of the body of Christ to the different parts of the body that play different\nfunctions. He was definite in verse 6 and encouraged the people to use their different\ngifts cheerfully for the service of God, whether it is prophesying, serving, teaching,\nencouraging, contributing to needs, leading and showing mercy. After all, the different\ngifts are all needed in the service of God.

He was loved by all in the\ncommunity because of his commitment to the academic progress of the students. After\nmany years of active service, he retired and almost immediately after another principal\nassumed duty. The new principal carefully studied what was on ground and decided to\nimprove on it.

The event recorded in this passage\ntook place before Jesus\\' arrest. As He earlier commanded (Luke 22:8), Peter and John had\nprepared the Passover meal, which consisted of a Passover lamb, bread without yeast\n(unleavened bread), wine and bitter herbs to be dipped in sauce. According to verse 17, when\nevening came, Jesus gathered the twelve disciples for the feast. While they were at the table,\nHe predicted His betrayal. He said to them, \u201cI tell you the truth, one of you will betray me, one\nwho is eating with me.\u201d (vv. 18-20) The disciples were disturbed and each of them said, \u201cSurely\nnot I?\" They declared their innocence about Jesus\\' betrayal, even Judas Iscariot, the betrayer,\nwho had connived with the high priest and other religious leaders to hand Jesus over. Jesus\\'\ndisposition at this time is quite exemplary. He knew He was fulfilling the Scriptures, although\nHe expressed displeasure about the fate of His betrayer without specifically mentioning the\nname. He simply said,\u201c\u2026woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man.\u201d (v. 21) He concluded\nthat it would have been better for such a man not to have been born.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Jesus\\' prediction that one of His disciples would betray Him is repeatedly stated in\nthe three gospels (Matthew 20:17-19; Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-33). To betray is the\nsame as being disloyal and deceptive. Judas kissed Jesus as a sign of betrayal, \u201cThe man I kiss is the one. Arrest him and take him away under guard.\u201d (Mark 14:44) So, they\narrested Jesus and held Him tight. It should be noted that the wickedness of Judas\nIscariot against Jesus was also against humanity. Even today, some people are still in the\nhabit of betraying Jesus through hypocritical lifestyle and disobedience to His Word.\nJesus\\' followers must be faithful to Him always and avoid the temptation to \u201cbetray\u201d Him\na second time. The reason is that anyone who betrays Jesus and the church will surely\nsuffer the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Considering the significance of the Passover Feast, what do you think would have\nmade Judas comfortable with the evil thought of betraying Jesus?

While they were eating, Jesus took a piece of\nbread, prayed, broke it and gave it to His disciples saying, \u201cTake it; this is my body.\u201d In like\nmanner, He took the cup gave thanks and gave it to them and they all drank from it.\nAccording to verse 24 He said, \u201cThis is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out\nfor many.\u201d This indeed is the new covenant, which Jesus made and was spoken of by\nProphet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31-34). The words of institution, \u201cThis is my body\u201d and\n\u201cThis is my blood\u201d echo the words of Passover liturgy. They can be likened to the bread of\naffliction, which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt.\u201d The new covenant that has Jesus\\'\nblood as a seal became necessary because the covenant God made with the people of\nIsrael at Mount Sinai was sealed with the blood of animals (Exodus 24:8) and was already\nobsolete for the remission of the sins of humankind (v. 13).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Every aspect of the observance of the Lord\\'s Supper is symbolic. Remarkably, the bread\nwithout yeast symbolises Jesus\\' body, which was broken for the remission of the sins of\nhumankind. Therefore, He is the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Furthermore, it was \\'one cup\\'\nthat He gave His disciples to drink from (Mark 14:23), an action that signifies unity among\nGod\\'s people. By the declaration in v. 24, Jesus connected the Passover Feast with the Sinai\nexperience (Exodus 24:8). His blood is thus the beginning of a new covenant, which is\npoured out for the redeemed (v. 24). However, while the former covenant had the blood of\nanimals as a seal, the new covenant has the blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all our\nsins. Therefore, no Christian should get entangled with blood sacrifices any more.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What are some wrong opinions Christians have about observing the Lord\\'s Supper\nand how can these be addressed?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Does the observance of the Lord\\'s Supper have any spiritual benefit and how should\nChristians prepare for it?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Covenant with Better Promises Hebrews 8:6-7, 10-12<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The writer of Hebrews describes Jesus as our High Priest. He has introduced a new and\nbetter covenant with promises because the first covenant was obsolete and subject to\ndestruction (Hebrews 8:13). Particularly in verse 6, the author acknowledged the fact\nthat the priestly ministry, which Jesus received, is superior to that of the other priests.\nSo, the covenant for which He is a Mediator is superior to the Old Testament covenant\nbecause it is based on the promises of better things. Of course, this suggests that the first\ncovenant was imperfect, hence the need for a better one. Therefore, God revealed the\ncharacteristics of the new covenant, which He intended to make with the house of Israel.\nHe promised to:<ol>\n<li>Put His laws in their minds, write them on their hearts, be their God and they will be\nHis people.<\/li>\n<li>Teach everyman how to know Him.<\/li>\n<li>Forgive their wickedness and remember their sins no more.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>It is worth mentioning that the new covenant is quite different from the old. While Jesus\nChrist brought to humankind a new and permanent covenant, which was sealed with His\nblood, the former was temporary and sealed with the blood of animals; thus, the sacrifice\nof Jesus supersedes it. In other words, the former covenant was weak and powerless to\nsave. However, the author did not condemn the old covenant but pictured it as a\ntemporary tutor until the arrival of the new. Furthermore, the demands of the old\ncovenant were written on tables of stone, but the new will be written on individuals hearts\nand minds. This covenant was established by Jesus, our perfect High Priest in the heavenly\ntemple with His own blood.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What do you think are the similarities and differences between the old and the new\ncovenant?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Why do some worshippers still cleave to the old covenant pattern and how do you\nthink this can be corrected?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>O Lord, may I not betray You by any means, in Jesus\\' Name.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray and ask God to help you celebrate the Lord\\'s Supper with reverence and awe all\nthe time.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Pray and ask God to give you grace not to compromise your loyalty to Christ.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Let class members find time to pray for those who have broken or are struggling with\ntheir marriage covenants.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>We should avoid the temptation to betray Jesus like Judas Iscariot.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>The Lord\\'s Supper is a spiritual exercise that should not be handled with levity.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>The new covenant of Jesus is superior to those of the Old Testament priests.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>Jesus is the Bread of Life.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>The Lord\\'s Supper has spiritual benefits.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>The new covenant gives believers better framework for kingdom usefulness.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":23,"title":"jesus seals the new covenant","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>June 9, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>JESUS SEALS THE NEW COVENANT<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Psalm 22:1-8, 21b-28<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Mark 14:32-50; 15<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t<p>Lesson Scripture:Mark 15:6-15, 25-26, 33-39<\/p>\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard His cry and saw how\nHe died, he said, \u201cSurely, this man was the Son of God!\u201d<b>Mark 15:39<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the various ways Jesus suffered\nfor our salvation.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Explain the implications of the tearing of\nthe temple curtain for believers.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Mention how believers can respond to\nwrong accusations, criticism and\nopposition without compromising their\nfaith.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>John Asabor lost his parents in a ghastly motor accident at a very tender age.

Of course, Pilate knew the\nJewish authorities arrested Him out of envy (v. 10) so, he was not comfortable sentencing\nan innocent man to death. Nevertheless, a decision had to be made since the people\nwanted Jesus crucified. At that time, it was the tradition that at every Passover Festival\nPilate would set free any prisoner of the people\\'s choice. Based on this custom, the people\ndemanded that Barabbas, a man who committed murder, be released to them instead of\nJesus. According to verse 12, Pilate asked the people again probably for the sake of clarity,\n\u201cWhat shall I do, then, with the one you call the King of the Jews?\u201d Unanimously, they\nagreed that Jesus should be crucified. They shouted, \u201cCrucify Him!\" Even when Pilate\ndemanded to know Jesus\\' offence, they shouted the more asking for His crucifixion. Pilate\nwas willing to please his people; therefore, he ordered the release of Barabbas.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It is noteworthy that Jesus did not make any defence for Himself while He was with\nPilate despite all the accusations. After all, He knew His time had come to fulfil the purpose\nfor which He was born, even though He was not a sinner. The responses of the people in\nverses 13 and 14b was an indication that they wanted Jesus crucified. Whereas, Barabbas\nwhose name means son of the father was a murderer, yet the Jewish authorities preferred\nhim set free and Jesus crucified.

So, having been flogged, he handed over Jesus to them. Immediately,\nthe soldiers led Him into the palace (that is, the praetorium) in company of other\nsoldiers. They mocked and treated Him like a criminal. He was made to carry His own\ncross and was finally crucified between two robbers at Golgotha (meaning the place of\nSkull). It was customary for the Jews to write a notice of the offence the condemned\nperson had committed. The two criminals crucified with Jesus had their charges written\non their crosses but no charge could be brought against Jesus.

At the ninth hour,\nJesus cried out in a loud voice saying, \u201cEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,\u201d which means, \"My\nGod, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d Unfortunately, the crowd misinterpreted His cry as a call for Elijah to come to His aid (vv. 35-36); thus they mocked Him saying \u201cNow leave\nhim alone. Let\\'s see if Elijah will come to take him down.\u201d The reference to Elijah was in\naccordance with the Jewish belief that he is expected to appear at the Passover time to\nherald the coming of God\\'s kingdom. According to verses 37 and 38, with a loud cry, Jesus\nbreathed His last and the curtain of the temple, which separated the Holy Place from the\nHoly of Holies was torn into two from top to bottom. This suggests that Jesus\\' death has\nopened the way for more intimate and direct relationship between God and humankind.\nFurthermore, it was an indication that it was not a human act. The climax of Jesus\\'\nexperience and death on the cross led to the centurion\\'s realisation that He is truly the Son\nof God (v. 39).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Even though it seemed like Jesus felt a sense of abandonment by His Father because\nof His pain, yet He knew He was doing His Father\\'s will.

He had Bundergone Sunbeam Band, Royal Ambassadors and some other discipleship\nprogrammes. Therefore, he understands that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the\ncross is more effective than the Old Testament sacrifices where the blood of animals was\nused as atonement for the sins of the people. It was the first Sunday of the year and\nBrother Solomon went to his neighbour\\'s church on invitation for a special programme,\nwhich was titled \u201cPurification for the New Year\u201d. During the service, Solomon watched\nwith amazement how every member of the church, both old and young walked to the\naltar and the pastor would dip his finger in a bowl containing red colour liquid, which\nthey claimed to be the blood of Jesus and put it on their foreheads. Solomon held to his\nconvictions from the Bible and refused to participate in the ritual knowing that blood is\nno longer needed for cleansing. He emphasised that the blood of Jesus that was shed on\nthe cross has obtained eternal salvation for believers.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Like these people, some Christians still believe in the sacrifice of animals for the\nremission of sins and as a means of protection. Today\\'s lesson is a reminder that the new\ncovenant\\'s sacrifice, which Jesus obtained with His blood through His death was the\ngreat sacrifice that inaugurated the era of grace for God\\'s covenant people. This great\nand permanent sacrifice calls for total submission to the will of God.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Jesus\\' Perfect Sacrifice Hebrews 9:11-14<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>While the author of Hebrews contrasted earthly and heavenly worship, he affirmed the\nsuperiority of Jesus\\' sacrifice and ministry. Verse 11 states that Christ has already come\nas the High Priest of the good things that are already here and He serves in a greater and\nmore perfect tabernacle. The author further described the tabernacle as one not made\nby humans; therefore, it is not a part of the created world. Unlike the Old Testament\npriests who offered the blood of animals, when Jesus went into the Most Holy Place He\ndid not offer the blood of animals as sacrifice. He was able to obtain salvation for us by\nthe sacrifice of His own blood (v. 12). The entry of the High Priest into the Most Holy\nPlace is like the entry of Jesus through death into the presence of God (Hebrews 1:3).\nAccording to verse 13, if the sprinkling of the blood of animals and the ashes of burnt\noffering could purify the people who were ritually unclean, how much more is the blood\nof Jesus, who offered Himself as a perfect sacrifice to God. The implication is that His\nblood can purify our consciences so that we may serve the living God.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The sacrifice of Christ supersedes all the sacrifices of the old dispensation. When He\ncame, the whole system was reformed (v. 10). As the perfect High Priest, He offered\nHimself as the perfect sacrifice, a single offering for the sins of humankind, which is valid\n for all time removing the sin of humankind completely. This type of sacrifice is at\nvariance with the various and repeated sacrifices of the Old Testament system.\nUltimately, His death has brought the will of God (the new covenant) into effect (9:16ff).\nTherefore, we can say that Christ has obtained eternal and perfect redemption (v. 12)\nbecause He offered Himself as a great sacrifice through the eternal Spirit (9:14). Anyone\nwho comes to Jesus must have total faith in Him alone, otherwise such a person is\nnegating the ministry of Christ.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What benefits has the priesthood of Jesus brought to believers?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>According to the passage, why is blood necessary for purification?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Jesus, the Great Mediator Hebrews 9:15<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Having examined the differences between Jesus\\' perfect sacrifice and the Old\nTestament system of sprinkling of the blood of animals for the remission of the sins of\nhumankind, the author concluded that Jesus is the Mediator of the new covenant. By\nthe shedding of His blood that is without blemish, He mediated between God and\nhumankind. He paid the necessary price to set them free from the sins committed under\nthe first covenant that the blood of animals and ashes of calves could not remove. As a\nresult, the called-out ones (believers) are guaranteed the eternal inheritance that God\nhas promised. In fact, this is made possible because people have been set free from the\nsins they committed under the first covenant. This means Christ\\'s redemption of\nhumankind is complete.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>A mediator is someone who plays the role of an intermediary between two persons.\nWe can, therefore, say that Jesus perfectly meets the demands of a mediator of the new\ncovenant, which is confirmed in verse 15. Paul attested to this fact in his letter to\nTimothy that Christ is the only Mediator between God and humankind (1 Timothy 2:5).\nIn Him, believers can find the real cleansing that does not come from the blood of\nanimals. All that the Aaronic mediation could offer was provisional forgiveness, until the\ntime of Christ. In fact, the best way to describe Jesus\\' sacrificial death is that He is a\nMediator. The only person that can always guarantee access to the Father is Jesus and\nnothing in all creation can take the place of Christ\\'s blood.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What are the functions of a mediator?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What does the new covenant require of believers?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Blood as Seal of a Covenant Hebrews 9:16-22<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The author of Hebrews in these verses used the analogy of a will to further explain the\nimportance of the blood that was shed in the new covenant. He likened it to a will that\nwould not be effective until after the death of its writer. He added that the first covenant\nwas established only after the shedding of blood of animals for the remission of the sins\nof the people. It is like the case of Moses who proclaimed all the commandments of the\nlaw to the people and thereafter sprinkled the mixture of the blood of the animals with\nwater on the book of the law and the people (Exodus 24:6-8). Then, he said, \u201cThis is the\nblood which seals the covenant that God has commanded you to obey.\u201d (v. 20) Invariably,\nthe new covenant is the will, which Christ made for His heirs that was not effective until\nafter His death. According to the law, almost everything is purified by the blood of\nanimals, and without the shedding of blood, sins are not forgiven. Of course, the Old\nTestament principle supports the fact that blood has the power to cleanse because the\nlife of every living thing is in their blood (Leviticus 17:11; 1 Peter 1:2).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The irony of the lesson is that if the blood of animals in the Old Testament time could\ncause the remission of sins, how much more effective is the blood of Jesus that is\nwithout blemish. Therefore, the new covenant has become effective since Christ shed\nHis blood. Accordingly, God\\'s inheritance in Christ eternal salvation, redemption, joy,\ninheritance, peace and forgiveness are for those who believe. Blood is life and without\nits shedding, there is no forgiveness of sins (v. 22). This is the mystery in God\\'s plan of\nsalvation for humankind.

Presumably, the old man knew that his days on earth were\nfew so he became more concerned about unity among his children. On his sick bed, he\ndemonstrated the importance of unity on a particular day. He ordered his first son to\nbreak a single broomstick and share his experience with his siblings. He then gave a\nbunch of broomsticks to his second son to break and also share his experience with his\nsiblings. Eventually, they all concluded that their unity was essential and agreed to be\nunited. They repeatedly echoed with their hands lifted, \u201cThere is power and progress in\nunity.

This was Paul\\'s\ncentral message when he wrote to encourage the Christians in Colossae concerning some\nmisleading information and false teaching in the church. He placed emphasis on the\nspiritual growth of the brethren. He also stressed the need to be united in love. In fact, it\nwas Jesus\\' prayer that believers be one (John 17:21-23), just as the Father and the Son are\none. But Satan always attempt to cause division among God\\'s people and unfortunately,\nsome believers are not sensitive to his tricks. However, today\\'s lesson is a reminder for\nbelievers to embrace true unity in Christ Jesus.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Encouragement to Be United in Love Colossians 2:1-5<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Although Paul did not plant the church in Colossae, he was concerned about her spiritual\ngrowth. From the beginning, it seemed he knew that false teachings will infiltrate the\nchurch, thus he made effort and encouraged them to be united in love. The reason for his\nencouragement is stated in verses 2, \u201c\u2026that they may be encouraged in heart and united\nin love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that\nthey may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ. And because Christ is God\\'s secret, He\nis the key that opens the hidden treasures of God\\'s wisdom and knowledge. Based on\nthese facts, Paul encouraged the brethren to refute every attempt by anyone to deceive\nthem with false teachings, no matter how appealing they may seem. He boasted of their\ncollective and resolute faith in the midst of their challenges, even though he was not with\nthem physically.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It is evident that believers in Colossae were under hostilities from what is referred to\nas the Colossian heresy. According to a Bible commentary, the attack was a combination\nof some extreme Judaism (Jewish worship) and Gnosticism (a form of philosophical idea\nthat emphasised special knowledge over faith in Christ). Certainly, Paul knew the harm of\ndivision and disunity such heresy could cause the church. The concern necessitated him to write to encourage the brethren to be united in love, which will unlock the full riches\nand complete understanding that is derived from Christ who is the mystery of God (2:2).\nExperience has shown that some churches are already divided as members are working\nagainst one another and the growth of the church is hindered as a result of false\ndoctrines. The only way to curb the widespread is to heed Paul\\'s advice to the brethren\nin Colossae and be united in love and purpose.

Although the church was faced with the\nproblem of false teaching; Paul continuously encouraged and reminded the Colossian\nbrethren to live in Christ just as they had previously received Him. Particularly in verse 7,\nbesides living in Christ he encouraged them to do three important things:<ol>\n<li>To be rooted and built up in Christ Jesus so that they will not be carried away by manmade\nregulations.<\/li>\n<li>To be strengthened in the faith as they have been taught from the beginning; when\nthey just accepted Christ.<\/li>\n<li>To be overflowing with thankfulness at least for the freedom they have in Christ.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>He further warned them against the dangers of being taken captive through false\ndoctrine and deceptive philosophy of men. The Scripture reveals that these teachings\nare based on philosophy, empty deceit, human tradition, and basic principles of this\nworld, including spiritual forces, rather than on Christ Jesus. In other words, they have\nno root in Christ (vv. 8, 20-23).<\/p>\n<p>Paul\\'s epistle to the church in Colossae is a call to perseverance in faith through Christ\nJesus, not minding the pressure to give in to human traditions and philosophy as it was in\nColossae. This can only be done when we are well-rooted in the Word of God and\nestablished in Christ with overflowing thanksgiving. As far as this passage is concerned,\neverything Paul wrote to the Colossians is vital for Christians of all ages. Therefore,\nbelievers should note that to be logically or philosophically correct is not necessarily the\nsame as to be biblically correct. When we know more about Jesus and are rooted in Him,\nwe are more equipped to discern false doctrine, its roots and the dangers they pose to the unity of the church. We are encouraged, therefore, to test every spirit and determine\nwhat is true or false teaching through the standard of Christ as revealed in the Scriptures.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What steps will your church take to help members to be rooted in Christ?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Identify some human regulations and knowledge that are in operation in our\nchurches today and how to stop its spread.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Supremacy of Christ Emphasised Colossians 2:9-15<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apart from the encouragement Paul gave to the Christians in Colossae to be rooted in\nChrist, he also emphasised the supremacy of Christ against any teaching that claims that\nChrist\\'s work of redemption was not sufficient. He acknowledged that \u201c... in Christ all the\nfullness of the deity dwells in bodily form\u201d (v. 9), therefore, believers have come to the\nfullness in Christ who is the Head over every power and authority (v. 10). The implication\nis that they have been circumcised by Christ Jesus and buried with Him. Through\nbaptism, they have been raised with Him because of their faith in the power of God who\nraised Him from the dead (v. 12). By virtue of the resurrection, they are fully alive\nbecause they have received forgiveness in Christ and the cancellation of all debts, which\nJesus nailed to the cross (v. 14). This, of course, is unlike the Mosaic law where everyone\nis a debtor to God. However, all these are guaranteed because Christ has \u201cdisarmed the\npowers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the\ncross.\u201d (v. 15) Interestingly, God did not only cancel the accusations of the law against\nbelievers, He also defused the works of the wicked one who lures people to believe false\nteachings. This means that angels and demons are subject to the power of Christ who\ndied and resurrected, thereby conquering the power of death.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The preeminence of Jesus is in the power of the cross as revealed in this passage. His\nclaim about Jesus\\' supremacy over spiritual rulers and authority (v. 10) refers to the\nangelic beings that apparently played a major role in the Colossian heresy. Paul\\'s\nresponse is for the Colossians to remember who they are in Christ and how they have\nbeen raised to a new life with Christ through their baptism. Accordingly, by being united\nwith Christ, believers have gained spiritual circumcision and should no longer be ruled by\nthe sinful nature (v. 11).<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the significance of water baptism to believers in relation to today\\'s\nlesson.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the spiritual implication of Paul\\'s declaration in verse 11.

Mr. Ugo, while being\noriented in his first few weeks in the company, was introduced to the different\nsections of the company and other staff members of the company. He was also told about\nthe mode of dressing, resumption time, entitlements and other work ethics. Obviously, the\nreason was that he would be properly guided in his working relationship with others. Mr\nUgo\\'s orientation can be likened to Jesus\\' Sermon on the Mount. It comprises of Jesus\\'\nteachings brought together into one coherent body meant to serve as guidance to the\ncommunity of faith. Jesus\\' intention was to show His followers how they ought to live in the\nworld, not simply according to a set of rules but by an inner revolution of attitude and\noutlook.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Our lesson today is primarily on the Beatitudes. The sermon centres on true happiness\nfor those who are poor spiritually, those who mourn, the humble, those who hunger and\nthirst for righteousness. It also includes the merciful, the pure in heart, peacemakers and\nthe persecuted. Ordinarily, no one thinks the categories of people listed above will ever find\nhappiness but this was Jesus\\' assurance in His sermon and each of the attitudes has its\ncorresponding blessing. Therefore, as many as belong to this groups of people should\ncount it all joy because of the promises attached to them.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Jesus and His Disciples Matthew 5:1-6<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus\\' threefold ministry of teaching, healing and preaching became widespread in the region\nof Galilee to Syria (Matthew 4:23-25). As a result, He became famous and a great crowd from\nGalilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judae and East of the Jordan followed Him. From verse 1 of\nchapter 5, Jesus went up to a mountainside. When He saw the crowd, He sat down and began\nto teach His disciples about right attitudes. According to verses 3 to 6, He turned human ideas\nabout happiness upside down. He pronounced corresponding blessings on the different\ngroups of persons. He said, blessed are:<ol>\n<li>Those who are poor in spirit because they will inherit the kingdom of heaven. It refers\nto the ultimate happiness and spiritual joy of those who have received the gift of\nsalvation.<\/li>\n<li>Those who mourn (those who are distressed because they are suffering). He\npromised that they will be comforted.<\/li>\n<li>The meek (humble) because they will inherit the earth (Psalm 37:1). The implication is\nthat they will live to enjoy peace and security in the land God has promised to give them.<\/li>\n<li>Those whose greatest desire is to do the will of God or hunger and thirst for\nrighteousness because they will be satisfied.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Obviously, the crowd, especially those mentioned in the passage may have had different\nexpectations about life\\'s challenges. It should be noted that those Jesus pronounced as divinely blessed are those who derive their sense of worth from God and not\nthemselves, those who exhibit godly mourning in repentance from sin and hunger for\ntrue righteousness and the humble. Most likely, some may have thought that true\nhappiness is measured by material possessions before Jesus\\' teaching. These teachings\nand divine blessings are vital and enough encouragement for Christians,\nnotwithstanding their experiences, especially the promise of the kingdom of heaven as a\nway of life for those who would follow Him.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>How can one be poor in spirit?

He has the power to know future events. He knew that Christians\nwill suffer persecution, insults and false accusations for His sake; thus He emphasised\nthese teachings of encouragement. As He continued in His teachings from verse 7 He\nsaid, blessed are:<ol>\n<li>The merciful (those who show compassion) for they will surely receive mercy.<\/li>\n<li>The pure in heart (those who are free from selfish ambition or any hidden motive but\nare wholly devoted to God). They will see God (Psalm 24:3-4).<\/li>\n<li>The peacemakers because they will be called sons of God.<\/li>\n<li>The persecuted, because of their pursuit of righteousness, the kingdom of heaven\nwill be their inheritance.<\/li>\n<li>Those who are persecuted insulted and accused falsely because of their faith in Jesus. He said\nsuch people should rejoice and be glad because their reward will be great in heaven. After all,\nthose who preach the message of God are often scorned and persecuted (Acts 7:52;\nMatthew 23:34). What is not fully explicit in the passage is what all the people did with the\nteachings of Jesus on the long run. According to Matthew 7:28-29, it was only stated that\nthey were amazed at the teachings of Jesus \u201cbecause He taught as one who had authority,\nand not as their teachers of the law.\u201d (v. 29)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus\\' Sermon on the Mount was not just a comic relief like the words of comedians or a\ndeclaration of manifesto by politicians. The entire passage is about the blessedness of\nthe persecuted, those who are insulted and accused falsely. He also gives the assurance\nthat great reward awaits victims of persecution in His name. Notable in the passage also\nis that each virtue has its own corresponding blessing. However, it should be noted that\nJesus\\' usage of the word \"Blessed\" does not indicate the receiving of material gifts or a temporary feeling of happiness, but rather a wholeness of one\\'s relationship with God.\nHence, having the right relationship with God is the key to real blessedness. The epistle\nof James also conforms to the teachings of Jesus (James 2:5, 13; 3:18; 4:9\u201310).\nBlessedness is not illusive unlike the world\\'s kind of blessedness. As for those who accept\nand live according to God\\'s standard, blessedness is their guaranteed portion.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Persecution is part of the journey of faith.

He was posted to one of the northern states for his National Youth Service\nCorps and deployed to a secondary school in a remote village for his primary\nassignment. Despite pressure from friends and family members to redeploy to another\nstate for security reasons, Sanjo refused and convinced them that God has sent him to the\nvillage for a purpose. Immediately he resumed, he identified with a Baptist church in the\n village, despite the language barrier. Sanjo was loved by all in the school, community and\nchurch. Every Saturday, he organised football matches; reading and Bible clubs on Sunday\nevenings, including free lesson for interested students. At the completion of his service\nyear, he donated a mini library to the school as his parting gift. He succeeded in influencing\nthe youths and teenagers as they became interested in the things of God. On the day of his\nsendforth, the village head described Sanjo as \u201cLight to the community\u201d.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Today\\'s lesson is popularly known as Sermon on the Mount or the Beatitudes.

According to verse 1 of the chapter, Jesus\nwent to the mountainside and when He saw the crowd, He began to teach them. He was\nspecific in verses 13 and 14 when He likened Christians to the salt of the earth and light of\nthe world. The two elements of His comparison are significant because salt has the\nability to improve the taste of food and to preserve it. Nevertheless, if salt loses its\nsaltiness and usefulness, it will no longer be good for anything except to be thrown away\nand trampled upon. Similarly, He compared light to a city set on a hill which cannot be\nhidden from far and near. Supposedly, light possesses the ability to illuminate the dark\nworld. So, it is expected to give brightness to everyone in the house. The implication of\nthe two elements is in verse 16, which says that citizens of heaven should not hide their\ngood works from others so that they will see and give praise to our Father in heaven.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Metaphors for light and darkness abound in the Scriptures, and they speak of the\nimportance of a Christian\\'s actions brightening a world that is plagued with the darkness\nof sin. By this teaching, Jesus encouraged His disciples to allow their light to shine before\nmen so that they will see their good works and glorify their Father (God). Failure to live up to this expectation is likened to salt that has lost its savour, or to light that is hidden\nunder a bushel. In Colossians, Paul talks about how Christians\\' words are to be seasoned\nwith salt and beneficial to hearers (Colossians 4:6). Our light must shine, by doing good\nworks that men would see and glorify God. The concept of doing good could be through\nour lifestyle. Nevertheless, they must be such that match our faith and are praiseworthy.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>How can believers positively influence their society for the glory of God, especially in\nthis contemporary world? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Let few members share how we, as Christians, can witness with our lives, especially\nwithin our neighbourhood. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Kingdom and the Law Matthew 5:17-20<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The scribes and Pharisees were two distinct groups. While the scribes drafted, maintained\nand interpreted the law in order to preserve Judaism in Israel, the Pharisees were known to\nbe meticulous in keeping the law. Presumably, the people started undermining the\nimportance of keeping the Mosaic law and concluded that Jesus had come to abolish it. In\nresponse, Jesus affirmed the permanent validity and authority of the law. He said in verse\n17, \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to\nabolish them but to fulfil them.\u201d He added that as long as heaven and earth remain, not\neven the smallest detail of the Law will be done away with until the end of all things.\nTherefore, those who disobey the smallest part of the commandment and teach others to\ndo so will be least in the kingdom of heaven while those who obey will be great. He\nconcluded that our faithfulness in doing the will of God must exceed that of the Pharisees\nand Teachers of the Law in order for us to enter the kingdom of heaven.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The scribes and the Pharisees believed that Jesus was acting in opposition to the\nteachings of the Mosaic law and the Prophets, whereas Jesus\\' teaching centres on the\nLaw and the Prophets, which find fulfilment in Him. As Paul teaches in Galatians 3, the\nlaw is incomplete and can only condemn; but forgiveness and righteousness for\nhumankind are made possible only through Jesus. Since the law is incomplete, it means\nthat the righteousness which the scribes and Pharisees claim is also incomplete. The\nrighteousness of Christ, which is imputed to every believer by faith alone is all we need to\nenter into the kingdom of God.

The enmity grew so serious that they\ntransferred it to their wives, children and even vowed never to reconcile again.\nEvery effort made by family and church members to reconcile the two brothers failed but they\ncontinued to pray for them. Surprisingly, the older brother who was offended decided to\ninitiate reconciliation. He said that apart from the fact that the pastor had consistently\npreached about the dangers of unforgiveness, anger and revenge, the topic of a particular\nSunday school which was \u201cThe necessity of loving one another and reconciliation\u201d touched\nhim. According to him, he sensed God was speaking to him to reconcile with his younger\nbrother, even though he was the one offended. They eventually reunited and became friends\nagain alongside their family members. Experience has shown that unforgiveness results in\nanger and sometimes murder; thus Jesus\\' emphasis in the passage..<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Today\\'s lesson is a reminder of our responsibility as believers to love one another\naccording to Jesus\\' teaching.

Jesus\\' phrase, \u201cYou have heard that it was said to the people\nlong ago\u2026\u201d was probably a reference to the Old Testament commandment that warned\nagainst murder because anyone who murders will be subject to judgment (Exodus 20:13).\nBut Jesus\\' explanation is that anyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to\njudgment. The statement presupposes the fact that both are serious offences that should\nbe avoided. He explained the consequences of the use of the words \u2018fool and Raca\u2019\n(which is a scornful word that originates from pride). It simply means that every malicious\nword used against one another is like poison that kills secretly and slowly. He concluded\nand recommended prompt reconciliation in verses 23-26 because a sacrifice offered by\nan individual is meaningless if he\/she has not been reconciled with other brethren.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It is most likely that the Jewish teachers had taught that nothing except actual\nth murder was forbidden according to the Mosaic law (the 6 Commandment). However, Jesus taught that the sin of anger is as serious as the sin of murder and no matter how\nlightly people take it, offenders will certainly face judgment. Particularly, when Jesus\nrefers to controlling one\\'s anger toward a brother or sister, it goes beyond those who are\nrelated to us by blood to every member of God\\'s family. The lesson is that we should\ncarefully preserve Christian love and peace with our brethren; and if at any time there is\na quarrel, we should confess our fault, exercise self-control, humble ourselves and seek\nreconciliation instead of putting up self-defence so that we will not be subject to\njudgment.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the importance of seeking reconciliation with those who offend us, or those\nwe offend.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What can Christians do to control their words or utterances when they are\nangry?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>How to Reconcile Matthew 5:25-26<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Having explained the importance of reconciliation before the offering of gifts on the altar,\nHe also explained how it should be done. He said to them, \u201cSettle matters quickly with your\nadversary who is taking you to court.\u201d (v. 25) His recommendation is that reconciliation\nshould be done early enough to avoid being handed over to the judge and the officer who\nwill eventually throw the individual into prison. The implication is that until what is owed is\npaid, the offender may not be released from prison. In fact, this explanation suggests that\nthere will sometimes be disagreement between people in the Christian community.\nHowever, Jesus\\' recommendation is that reconciliation should be sought probably at the\nbeginning of the quarrel so that the punishment of being thrown into the prison by the\nofficer in charge can be avoided.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>One of the reasons for prolonged quarrel, enmity, uproar, fighting and killing, even\namong Christians today is the failure of people to quickly reconcile their differences\nwhenever there is a problem. What is common among people is that both the offender\nand offended claim to be right without the spirit of humility and the willingness to\ninitiate reconciliation for the sake of peace. According to Jesus\\' recommendation in the\npassage, Christians should be peace-loving and whenever there is a disagreement;\neither of the parties should be ready to initiate a reconciliation early enough to avoid\nbeing taken to the court of law and risk imprisonment.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Should Christians take one another to court for settlement? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Apart from approaching a court, discuss other ways Christians can settle their\ndisagreements. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Whose duty is it to initiate reconciliation?

He stated the basic concept of the law on adultery and condemned lust, which leads to\nit. He said looking lustfully at a woman is practically the same as committing adultery. This\nmeans that it is not enough to abstain from certain behaviours that are contrary to the law but\nthe inner motives that cause it must be dealt with. As a permanent solution, He\nrecommended that any part of the body that causes us to sin should be cut off and thrown\naway (probably to put under control) because it is better to lose a part than for the whole body\nto go to hell. Noteworthy in the passage is the fact that Jesus did not mean physical cutting of\nthe flesh but the need to deal with the passions and feelings that easily lead to sin. In the\nfollowing verses, Jesus quoted the Old Testament law, which supports divorce by merely giving\na certificate of divorce to the woman (Deuteronomy 24:1-4); but Jesus broadened the concept\n He said, anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness has caused the\nwoman and the man she will eventually be married to become adulterers.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>One major truth from the passage is that God hates divorce. Even though Moses\npermitted divorce in his days, this did not equate to God\\'s preferred actions in marriage.\nJesus\\' teachings centre on the fundamental meaning and purpose of marriage. God\\'s\nintention for a man and woman is to remain faithful in marriage until death separates\nthem. This presupposes the fact that the bond made when the two became one flesh is not\ndissolvable, they are to remain faithful to their marital vows until death separates them.\nTherefore, Christians should understand these principles and avoid anything that will lead\nto divorce because its effect on the home, children, church and the society is awful.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the effects of divorce on the children and the couple themselves\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>State some causes of divorce and how to avoid them.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>What are the consequences of breaking marital vows?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray that God will help you to control your words and thoughts, especially when you\nare angry.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray that God will help all Christian couples to maintain their vows and marriage\ncommitments.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Pray for God\\'s help to resolve conflicts with others as easily and as quickly as possible.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Let the class discuss practical ways Christian couples can maintain their marriage\ncommitments.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>God is more concerned about the state of our hearts than our actions.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Christians should seek reconciliation with other brethren before reconciling with\nGod.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Forgiveness is a necessary condition for receiving God\\'s blessing.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>Christians should be ready to keep their marriage vows and commitments.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>Divorce is a sin.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Believers should be peace-loving.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Avoid anything that can cause you to sin against God and humankind.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":29,"title":"jesus teaches about transforming love","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>July 21, 2019<\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>JESUS TEACHES ABOUT TRANSFORMING LOVE<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Romans 12:9-21<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Matthew 5:38-48<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>You have heard that it was said, \\'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.\\' But I tell\nyou: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.<b>Matthew 5:43-44<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Define true love and what it entails.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Discuss how Christians can overcome\nthe spirit of revenge or retaliation.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Discuss practical ways of relating with\none\\'s enemies.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n<li>Resolve to love people as God loves\nthem.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Man is prone to retaliate for any wrong done to him.

Some years later,\nthe man lost his job and at a time, he needed his cousin\\'s help. Although he initially\nrefused and wanted to revenge, he was encouraged by Jesus\\' command to love our\nenemies, even those who persecute us. The testimony is that he had peace in his heart\nfor the opportunity to bless someone who once refused to assist him.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Today\\'s lesson focuses on Jesus\\' teaching about our attitude on revenge, love for\nenemies and practical Christian lifestyle that can bring about transformation in the society.\nThese teachings are principles that can help Christians relate with one another in God\\'s\nlove, notwithstanding people\\'s attitude toward us or our past experiences.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Transforming Love Explained Matthew 5:38-42<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus was explicit in His teachings about the character of citizens of heaven. Having taught\nabout anger, adultery and divorce in the previous verses, He further taught on revenge and\nlove for enemies. He made a comparison between the Old and New Testament teachings.\nAccording to verse 38 He said, \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \\'Eye for eye, and tooth for\ntooth\\'. This is a statement of retaliation whereby a penalty is made to fit the offence\ncommitted. But in the next verse, Jesus explained a better way of showing love that\ntransforms. He said:<ol>\n<li>Do not revenge. Instead, when someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the\nother side (v. 39).<\/li>\n<li>If someone wants to take your tunic, give him your cloak as well.<\/li>\n<li>If you are forced to go one mile with someone, go with him two miles.<\/li>\n<li>Give to those who ask and do not turn away from those who desire to borrow from you.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Jesus\\' comparison is a reference to the law of retribution, which is found in the Old\nTestament (Deuteronomy 19:20-21). He, however, broadened and explained the concept\nof true love rather than retaliation. Jesus\\' instruction to turn the other cheek (v. 39) was a\nstrict prohibition against self-defence. No doubt that Jesus only encouraged the exhibition\nof true love that transforms by refusing revenge over an offence. The plain instruction is\nwhen we tolerate one another despite offences against us, there will be peace and harmony in our society and this is true love. True love entails tolerance, forgiveness and\nthe willingness to go extra mile(s) with others, no matter their offences against us.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Should Christians pray for the death and destruction of their enemies?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Is it good for a Christian to defend him\/herself in the face of attacks?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>How will you describe someone who graciously turned his face to the other side to be\nslapped in this modern society?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Love for Enemies Explained Matthew 5:43-48<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Before Jesus concluded the Sermon on the Mount, He made a categorical statement\nabout the right attitude towards one\\'s enemy. He said we should love and pray for those\nwho persecute us. This is against the command to love only our neighbours and hate our\nenemies. The reason for the command is clear; \u201cthat you may be sons of your Father in\n heaven\" people whose character and conduct match that of the Lord, who does good,\nboth to the righteous and the unrighteous (v. 45). Unfortunately, the Jewish teachers\nhad the understanding of a \\'neighbour\\' as those who were of their own country, nation\nand religion but Jesus said that those who do the will of the Father are His brothers and\nsisters (Matthew 12:50). According to verse 46, there is no reward if we love only those\nwho love us like the tax collectors and greet only our brothers because even pagans do\nsame. He, therefore, concluded by saying, \u201cBe perfect, therefore, as your heavenly\nFather is perfect.\u201d\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The command for believers to \u201cbe perfect\u201d (v. 48) is common in the Scriptures. It is a\ncall to do the right thing and it is God\\'s standard for His children. The command was an\nencouragement to the disciples to adopt God\\'s standard of holy living, which is\ncharacterised by perfect love to all, notwithstanding their religion, race, gender or tribe.\nThis presupposes the fact that our lifestyle should supersede others, especially the\npagans who love and relate with those who are related to them. This is one of the\npractical ways of relating to our enemies when we conform to the example of our\nHeavenly Father (1 Peter 1:15-16) who does not discriminate but blesses everyone, even\nthe unrighteous.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>As believers, should we wait for our offenders to ask for forgiveness before we forgive\nthem?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What do you think Jesus meant in verse 47? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>Let at least three members share how they were able to control the urge to revenge\nor retaliate a wrong done to them.<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Ask God to help you maintain a Christian lifestyle that attracts others to Christ.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>I release those who have offended me as I forgive them.

Today, there are many\nmagicians, astrologians, witch-doctors, and African traditional healers who\nsometimes accurately predict an event (Acts 16:16). Their activities are noticeable and\nalmost widespread already. Although they pretend to represent God, preach the Gospel,\nwork miracles, heal and conduct deliverance for people, they are agents of darkness.\nThey masquerade in different garbs purposely to lure innocent people into believing\ntheir false predictions with exorbitant prices. Consequently, it has become extremely\ndifficult to differentiate true prophets from others. Hence, Jesus and the apostles\nrepeatedly warned that there would be false prophets in the end times (Matthew 24:24)\nwho will not be authorised by God to speak His mind to humankind.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The lesson also focuses on Jesus\\' warning against judging others presumably to point\nout their faults without dealing first with your own faults, which may be worse. In all,\nChristians need spiritual discernment to be able to distinguish true from false prophets\nas well as deal with our own sins before we can point to the faults of others. Many times,\nwe judge people wrongly because of lack of spiritual discernment. This is the crux of\ntoday\\'s lesson.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Jesus Condemns Judging Others Matthew 7:1-6<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The Sermon on the Mount about the lifestyle of the citizens of the kingdom is all\ninclusive. This passage has to do with relationships within the Christian community. In\nverses 1 and 2, Jesus warned the disciples against judging other people in an arrogant\nand fault-finding way, especially as they too had their own weakness. He said to them,\n\u201cDo not judge others, so that God will not judge you, for God will judge you in the same\nway as you judge others, and he will apply to you the same rules you apply to others.\u201d This\ncommand not to judge others is also found in Mark chapter 4 verse 24. Also apparent in\nthe passage is the folly of pointing to someone\\'s faults, which may be wrong without first\n dealing with one\\'s own faults. Jesus said in verse 6, \u201cDo not give what is holy to dogs\nthey will only turn and attack you. Do not throw your pearls in front of pigs they will only\ntrample them under foot.\u201d The use of dogs and pigs in the passage is significant.\nAccording to the Old Testament tradition, dogs were held in low esteem while pigs were\nclassified as unclean animals (Leviticus 11:7; Deuteronomy 14:8). Nonetheless, they are\nused to represent people who are unable and unwilling to appreciate the value of\nspiritual truths.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Notably, the exhortation to \u201cfirst take the log out of your own eye\u201d (v. 5) was a necessary\nwarning. It emphasises the importance of regularly evaluating our own actions and motives before we can help our Christian brothers and sisters identify their deficiency\nwithout hypocrisy. It is also an admonition to those who call attention to little faults in\nother people, whereas they are engaged in greater sins. They can be described as people\nwhose minds have been blinded by the god of this world. The lesson in verses 1-2 did not\nactually condemn divine, civil, and all forms of interpersonal judgment rather they\ncondemned the act to overly talk about the faults of others out of pride, criticism and selfrighteousness.\nHowever, what the lesson emphasises is to first and foremost judge\nourselves, our own actions and attitudes before we pass judgment on others. Jesus\\' point\nof emphasis is the importance of using discernment in evaluating the behaviours and\nmotivations of others.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Explain how a person\\'s behaviour can reflect his or her character.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Why do some Christians easily justify their own behaviours and condemn that of\nothers\\'?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Discuss the best ways to correct wrong behaviour in others without necessarily\njudging them.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Warning against False Prophets Matthew 7:15-23<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Jesus\\' teaching also included warning not to be deceived by false prophets who oppose\nthe truth with the claim that their message is from God. The warning was clear and\nconcise. He said in verse 15, \u201cThey come to you in sheep\\'s clothing, but inwardly they are\nferocious wolves.\u201d According to verse 16, they can easily be identified by their behaviour\nthat contradicts what they do. Their activities are likened to the impossibility of picking\ngrapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles. After all, only healthy trees bear good\nfruits and a bad tree bears bad fruits. On the contrary, a good tree cannot bear bad fruits;\nlikewise a bad tree cannot bear good fruits. However, the bottom line is that any tree\nthat does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (hell is a place of\nfinal destruction) Luke 3:19. In verse 21, Jesus made clear the conditions for entering the\nkingdom of heaven. \u201c\u2026only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven\u201d. Even\nthough many would claim to have prophesied in His name, driven out demons and\nperformed many miracles, on the day of judgment, He would say to them: \u201cI never knew\nyou. Away from me, you evil-doers!\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The activities of false prophets who claim their message is from God is already\nwidespread in our contemporary time; thus Jesus\\' warning to watch out for them is\nnecessary. Their aim is to deceive and lead people into error, even though they may appear like genuine preachers of the Gospel with the gift of performing miracles.\nTherefore, we need to be spiritually sensitive in order to identify and be able to avoid\nthem. We must also know that the true test of discipleship is obedience to the Word of\nGod. More importantly, we are encouraged to examine ourselves to be sure that we are\nnot false disciples of Christ. This means that we must evaluate our behaviour in the light\nof the teachings of Jesus.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>How do we identify false prophets?

They have been known to be fond of each other, loyal and dedicated\nto the good of each other. Their friendship eventually united their parents as well as\ntheir other family members. After their graduation, they were posted to different states\nfor their National Youth Service Corps. After their service year, while they were both\napplicants, brother James was approached by some criminals in the community to\nbetray his friend John (because his parents are wealthy) so he could be kidnapped, with\nthe promise to have a share from the ransom that would be paid. For some time, James\nwas threatened by these criminals but he made up his mind to rather suffer the\nconsequences of his refusal to betray his childhood friend, notwithstanding the financial\nbenefit. His reason was that they have both made a covenant to be true friends, whether\nin life or death<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The story above is a replica of the bond of friendship that existed between David and\nJonathan. Their hearts were knitted together so much that Jonathan made a covenant\nwith David because he loved him as himself (1 Samuel 18:3). When Saul threatened to take\nthe life of David, his friend Jonathan revealed the plans to him and even pacified his father.\nTherefore, David and Jonathan\\'s relationship has become one of the best examples of true\nfriendship in the history of humankind. The focus of today\\'s lesson is the amazing bond\nthat existed between Jonathan and David.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Covenant Between Two Friends 1 Samuel 18:1-5<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The killing of Goliath by David was a feat in the history of the Israelites. The achievement\ndid not only remove shame and reproach from the people of God, it also attracted the\nattention of King Saul who demanded to know his identity (1 Samuel 17:58). After Saul\\'s\nconversation with David, his son Jonathan was attracted to him and loved him as much\nas he loved himself. From that day onward, Saul kept David with him and did not let him\ngo back home. According to verse 3, Jonathan made a covenant of eternal friendship\nwith David because of his love for him. To further prove his love for him, Jonathan\nremoved his royal robe and gave it to David, his tunic, sword, bow and his belt. The\nremoval of these materials symbolises the transfer of the monarchy from the house of\nSaul (because of his disobedience to God\\'s command) to the house of David as the heir\nto the throne. David was obedient to Saul and whatever he sent him to do, he did\ndiligently; thus Saul gave him a high rank in the army. Saul\\'s action pleased all the people\nincluding his officers (v. 5).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>A covenant is an agreement or a pledge between two parties whereby the individuals\ninvolved are bound together with some conditions that must be adhered to by both parties. In fact, the friendship between Jonathan and David is rare. They were loyal and truthful to one another, even when it became clear that David was to replace him as the\nsuccessor of his father\\'s throne. Ordinarily, they would have been rivals but Jonathan\nseemed to have understood the fact that David was destined to become king. His loyalty\nto David was without equal. So, he established an eternal relationship with him with the\npromise to love him as he has loved himself. Christians should emulate this type of\nfriendship, which is characterised by sincere love, care, loyalty and reliability among\nother virtues.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What exactly attracted Jonathan to David so much that he loved him instantly and\nentered into a covenant with him?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the significance of Jonathan\\'s removal of his robe, armour, sword, bow and\nbelt.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Discuss the consequence of David\\'s diligence in his service to King Saul and the\nlesson it teaches.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Saul\\'s Plan to Kill David 1 Samuel 19:1-7<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Somebody once said, \u201cJealousy is a natural disease that can lead to murder\u201d. No sooner than Saul\npromoted David and made him an officer in his army, he became jealous and planned to kill him.\nThe idea came to King Saul when he noticed David\\'s brilliant victory over the Philistines (chapter 14)\nand his fame, which was already well known. He told his son Jonathan and all the officials to kill him\nbut because of the strong bond between Jonathan and David, the secret was revealed to David by\nJonathan. He said to him, \u201cMy father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard\ntomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. I will go out and stand with my father in the field\nwhere you are. I\\'ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.\u201d (vv. 2-3) It should be noted\nthat Jonathan did not only reveal his father\\'s plot to kill his beloved friend David, he also promised to\nappease his father. According to verse 4, Jonathan spoke well of David and reminded his father\nsome important things about him. For instance:<ol>\n<li>David\\'s innocence. (v. 5)<\/li>\n<li>The benefit of what he has done (probably the shame and reproach he was able to\nsave Israel from).<\/li>\n<li>How he risked his life when he killed Goliath.<\/li>\n<li>The great victory God won for all Israel.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Interestingly, Saul listened to the counsel of his son Jonathan. He was convinced by what he said\nand thereafter made a vow in the name of the Lord not to kill him. Having told David the whole\nconversation with his father, Jonathan took him to his father and he served him as before (v. 9).<\/p>\n<p>The difference between Jonathan and David\\'s friendship and what is happening in our\ncontemporary world is obvious. Without doubt, Jonathan was a trusted and loyal friend to\nDavid. He did not allow rivalry; rather, he played the role of a good mediator and as well maintained a balanced loyalty to his father and David, his friend. There was transparency and\nsincere love between them unlike some people who conveniently betray their friends either\nas a result of jealousy or for the sake of position, fame or money. However, the consequences\nof such action are usually guilt, shame, regret and sometimes death because God will always\nfrustrate the plans of the wicked.

Today,\npeople\\'s reaction varies when they are bereaved. While some easily conclude that they\nhave been forgotten by God and as such backslide, some put their trust in humankind\nand others live depressed and frustrated lives.<\/p>\n<p>The story of Ada is similar to the story of Ruth in the Bible. After the death of her\nhusband, she did not give in to dejection. She refused to go back to her hometown like her\nmate Orpah with a determination to serve her mother-in-law, Naomi in the land of\nBethlehem. She demonstrated loyalty and devotion to her mother-in-law, Naomi, to the\npoint that she found favour in the sight of Boaz who eventually became her husband. She\ngave birth to a son Obed, an ancestor of the Saviour. The focus of today\\'s lesson is the faith of\na Moabite woman Ruth, her loyalty, devotion and sacrificial love for her mother-in-law, in the\nland of Bethlehem. Though a foreigner, she adopted the people, land, and the God of Israel.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Naomi Decides to Return to Bethlehem Ruth 1:6-11<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>There was a great famine in the days when judges ruled Israel before they had a king. As a\nresult, Elimelech, his wife Naomi and their two sons decided to go and live for a while in\nMoab. Unfortunately, he died and after about ten years, their two sons Kilion and Mahlon\nalso died (vv. 1-5). When God visited His people and there was abundance of food, Naomi\ndecided to return to Bethlehem, where the extended family members of her late husband\nwould be required by tradition to take her in. In verse 8, Naomi bade her two Moabite\ndaughters-in-law farewell and urged them to go back to their hometown perhaps to find new husbands. She prayed for them saying, \u201cMay the LORD show kindness to you, as you\nhave shown to your dead (her two sons) and to me. May the LORD grant that each of you will\nfind rest in the home of another husband.\u201d (v. 8) Although they insisted they will go with her\nto Bethlehem, Naomi made it clear that she had nothing to offer them anymore (v. 11). In\nother words, she could no longer have sons who will grow to become their husbands;\ntherefore, their decision to go with her to Bethlehem may be unwise and unprofitable.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Naomi\\'s decision for her daughters-in-law to remain in Moab is genuine because\ntheir chances of finding new husbands among the Moabite men would be greater than\namong Jewish men who would not likely want to marry Moabite women (Deuteronomy\n23:3). However, the determination of the two women to follow their mother-in-law to\nBethlehem is commendable. After all, as widows, they were not legally obligated to\nremain with Naomi. So, their desire to remain with their mother-in-law was simply an act\nof devotion and loyalty to her and perhaps their late husbands. In fact, loyalty and\ndevotion are necessary for a steady marriage relationship but unfortunately today, many\nwomen lack this Christian attitude. Little wonder there is crisis in some homes and the\nrate of divorce is daily increasing, even among Christians.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>According to verse 6, God visited Bethlehem and there was abundance of food.

Earlier on, she had shown the two women\naffection when she kissed and bade them farewell with tears (v. 9). Again in verse 14, they\nboth wept as Orpah kissed and wished her goodbye with the desire to return home but\nRuth clung to her, despite Naomi\\'s reminder of Orpah\\'s decision to go back in verse 15. Her\nresponse was astounding. She said to her, \u201cDon\\'t urge me to leave you or to turn back from\nyou. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people\nand your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried\u2026.\u201d (v. 16) Indeed, it\nwas an expression of loyalty and devotion to Naomi, regardless of the fact that Ruth was\nnot certain of her future in a foreign land. Particularly, she swore an oath with the name of\nthe God of Israel that only death would separate them. Naomi finally realised that Ruth\nwas determined to go with her; so she stopped urging her to go back to her people.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The story of Ruth and Naomi remains one of the most existing biblical stories that\ndemonstrate devotion and commitment to one another. According to verse 14, Naomi\\'s\nappeal to the two women to go back to their hometown finally made meaning to Orpah.\nShe sorrowfully returned home probably with the hope of a second marriage. But Ruth\nwill not leave Naomi to a lonely old age. Her choice is Naomi\\'s people, and significantly,\nher God and they both got to Bethlehem where they began a new life. The faith and\ncourage Ruth demonstrated in her relationship with Naomi is exceptional. Although a\nGentile\/foreigner from a despised group of people, her devotion to Naomi in her state of\ndespair was unusual and complete.

She went to a field, which coincidentally belonged\nto Boaz to pick up the leftover grains for their consumption. Her hard work attracted the\nattention of Boaz with whom she found favour. In chapter 3, Naomi was moved with\npassion to find a home for Ruth who had shown her love. And because Boaz is a kinsman\nand will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor that night, Naomi instructed Ruth to\nprepare herself like a bride and go down to the threshing floor to meet Boaz. She said to\nher, \u201cWash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the\nthreshing floor, but don\\'t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and\ndrinking.\u201d (v. 3) She was also instructed to be watchful when he lies down so that she\nwould go and uncover his feet, probably a formal act of commitment to marriage\n(Ezekiel 16:8). According to verse 5, Ruth responded in the affirmative. She said to her\nmother-in-law, \u201cI will do whatever you say\u201d (v. 5), and straight away, she went to the\nthreshing floor and did everything Naomi had told her. This, of course, was another\nconfirmation that she was a woman of noble character.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Obviously, Naomi knew that Ruth needed to remarry, especially to a kinsman\nredeemer who would take over the responsibilities of her late husband as tradition demands and inherit his landed property, since women had no right of inheritance.\nWithout doubt, Naomi\\'s advice to Ruth was for the purpose of appealing to Boaz\\'s\nkinsman obligation and a request for marriage. Therefore, following Naomi\\'s\ninstructions, Ruth initiated a covenant of marriage. However, it should be noted that the\nsuggestive phrases in the passage like, lie down, uncover and feet were all indications\nthat Ruth was interested in marrying Boaz for the purpose of the continuation of her\nhusband\\'s lineage. Certainly, the relationship, mutual love and concern between Ruth\nand Naomi, her mother-in-law, has remained a standard for all ages.

Without delay, Ruth introduced herself as his\n\\'servant\u201d. She said to him, \u201cSpread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a\nkinsman redeemer. By implication, Ruth requested Boaz to marry her because he is a\nclose relative to Elimelech, her late father-in-law. Interestingly, the request pleased Boaz\nbut it was not granted immediately because, according to Boaz, there was a closer\nkinsman redeemer than himself. However, he blessed her and said, \u201cThe LORD bless you,\nmy daughter\u2026 \u201cThis kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not\nrun after the younger men, whether rich or poor.\u201d (v. 10) He encouraged and promised to\nmeet her needs based on the fact that she is a woman of noble character, which is well\nknown to the town\\'s men.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Boaz\\'s commendation of Ruth\\'s character in verse 11b is an attestation to the fact\nthat a good name is more desirable than great riches and to be esteemed is better than\nsilver and gold.

Throughout the passage, Ruth\\'s activities show that she was determined, persistent, hardworking and devoted to the well-being of Naomi, her\npeople and God. After all, she would have opted for a younger man, whether poor or rich\nin the community according to her choice (v. 10). In fact, Boaz commended Ruth\\'s\nsincerity and firmness to a point that he addressed her as \u201cmy daughter\u201d. He assured her\nof doing everything she has asked for probably after the issue of kinship has been\ndetermined. Ultimately, Boaz became responsible for the restoration of Ruth and\nNaomi, and the continuation of the lineage of their dead husbands.

He added that\nPaul\\'s advice for submission in any marriage relationship is more of love rather than\ncontrol.

Beginning from verse 21, Paul became concerned\nabout family life that brings newness, particularly the ideal relationship between\ncouples. He said, \u201cSubmit to one another out of reverence for Christ.\u201d Simply put, the\nphrase \u201cto one another\u201d suggests that submission should be a mutual responsibility\nbetween couples based on their reverence for Christ.

The\ncommand to be submissive is so important that it is repeated in verse 22. He said,\n\u201cWives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.\" In other words, wives are to submit to\ntheir husbands as if their submission is to the Lord because that is what they should do\nas Christians (Colossians 3:18; 1 Peter 3:1). Paul\\'s reason for this command is that the\nhusband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church. Therefore, as the\nchurch submits to Christ so wives should submit in everything to their husbands (v. 24).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>To submit is the same thing as to surrender, yield or be loyal to another person.\nAlthough some couples often misunderstand submission, it has remained a key principle\nin maintaining successful Christian marriages. The fact is that when we submit to God in our relationship with Him, we will be more willing to submit to others. Today, lack of\nsubmission and genuine love for one another are some causes of disagreements in some\nhomes. Therefore, Christian couples should know that it is their responsibility to subject\ntheir rights to one another in their relationship. Particularly, the wife should be willing to\nfollow her husband\\'s leadership because he is the head of the family just as Christ is the\nhead of the church. However, it should be noted that Paul\\'s exhortation for wives to be\nsubmissive to their husbands does not in any way suggest that husbands should enslave\ntheir wives.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What are some causes of instability in the home? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Suggest ways in which Christian families can live happily together.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>What roles can the church play in maintaining successful Christian homes?\n<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Command to Love Ephesians 5:25-29<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Paul\\'s admonition to the brethren in Ephesus was all-inclusive.

However, at every given time, both marriage partners are\ncommanded to \u201cbe subject to one another\u201d (v. 21).<\/p>\n<p>Just as mutual submission is an essential ingredient in a successful Christian home,\nlove is also very important. The implication of this is that the husband\\'s love should be\nsacrificial and not a selfish love that exercises control over his wife.

He said in verse 30, \u201cFor we are\nmembers of his body\u201d (His church). Also in verse 31, the Scripture says, \u201cFor this reason a man\nwill leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh.\u201d\nThis is a reference to the Old Testament account when God instituted marriage that a man will\nleave his parents and be united in marriage with his wife and establish a new family unit\n(Genesis 2:24). However, Paul found a deeper meaning in the passage of the union between a\nhusband and wife, which reflects the relationship between Christ and the church (v. 32).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The summary of Paul\\'s admonition to the church in Ephesus is that both husband\nand wife should play their different roles in order to have a steady relationship like Christ\nand the church. The church is the bride of Jesus and just like a husband cares for his wife,\nJesus loves the church to the point that He gave His life for her in order to dedicate her to\nGod by His Word after washing it clean with water. The reason is to present her (the\nchurch) to God faultless (vv. 26-27). Noteworthy in the passage is Paul\\'s appeal that\nevery husband must love his wife as himself, and every wife must respect her husband (v.\n33). Christian couples should, therefore, understand that the oneness of a married\ncouple is a symbol of the oneness of Christ and the church. Thus, couples are expected to\nsubmit to Him in all things.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Explain what the man\\'s leaving in verse 31 means when actually it is the woman who\nleaves.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the different ways God cares for the church and the response of believers to\nHim.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray and ask God to give you grace to remain committed to your marital vows.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>God, help every Christian couple to remain united like the union between Christ and the\nchurch.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Pray for every troubled home for love, peace and understanding to maintain God\\'s\nstandard for their homes.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Compare and contrast the instructions to husbands and wives and determine\nwhich is more difficult to practice and why.<\/li>\n<li>Select and sing a hymn about commitment and mutual love.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Christian couples should imitate Christ\\'s love for the church as a model for how\nthey should relate with each other.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Mutual love, submission and respect should be practised in every Christian home.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>It is God\\'s desire for Christian couples to live in peace and harmony.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>God instituted marriage.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>Love and submission are two ingredients needed for a successful marriage.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>When genuine love exists in a home, it makes life enjoyable.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":35,"title":"faith and doubt","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>September 1, 2019<\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>FAITH AND DOUBT<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Luke 17:22, 26-37<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Genesis 18:16 19:29<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t<p>Lesson Scripture:Genesis 19:1, 15-26, 29<\/p>\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered\nAbraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe\nthat overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.<b>Genesis 19:29<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Narrate the event that led to the\ndestruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the effects of faith and\ndoubt as seen in the text.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>State at least three lessons they\ncan learn from the life of Lot\\'s wife.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Okolomu is a small and remote village. The people are known for their Owickedness and hostility, especially to strangers and the Christians among\nthem. They were involved in idol worship, kidnapping, and pipeline vandalism.\nSometime ago, it was reported that three young men gang-raped a female youth corp\nmember who was serving in the community. There were always terrible allegations\nabout their cruelty without respect for the law. Despite several warnings from the Police\nForce through their king, the people failed to change. The last warning was with a\npromise to arrest all the villagers if they continued in their wickedness. Truly, when the\nnews of the kidnap of the king of the village reached the Police, the whole town was\nraided and all the men; particularly the young ones were arrested and put in prison,\nespecially those who doubted and ignored the warning of the Police. However, a few\nwho heeded the warning and discontinued their evil activities were spared.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The case of the people of Okolomu can be likened to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.\nThere were terrible accusations against the people because of their sins. But before the city\nwas utterly destroyed, God decided to investigate (v. 21), whether the accusations were true.\nEventually, the city was destroyed with burning sulphur along with all the people and\neverything that grew in the land except Lot and his family. Today\\'s lesson focuses on the\ndestruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It also describes how faith in God and the acts of\nhospitality exercised by Abraham saved Lot and his household, except his wife who turned to\na pillar of salt on the way because she disobeyed the instruction \u2018 do not look back\\'.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Lot Entertains Angels Genesis 19:1<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>There were terrible accusations against the people of Sodom and Gomorrah because of\ntheir wickedness. After the conversation between God and Abraham over God\\'s\nintention and determination to destroy the city and its inhabitants (Genesis 18:16-33),\ntwo angels arrived in the evening to carry out the mission. Lot was sitting at the gateway\nof the city, which served as a commercial centre where business activities were carried\nout and judgements were executed. Perhaps, his sitting at the gateway was in\nconnection with the position he occupied according to verse 9. The Scripture says that as\nsoon as Lot saw them, he reverenced them:<ol>\n<li>He got up and went to meet them.<\/li>\n<li>He bowed down with his face to the ground, an indication that Lot recognised them as\nsupernatural beings whom should be respected, even though their mission may not\nbe clear to him.

Little wonder, he was\ncommended as a righteous man who lived among unrighteous people (2 Peter 2:7-8). His\nwarm reception and reverence for the men without doubt were instrumental to his\ndeliverance from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The author of Hebrews later\nmade reference to his act of hospitality and encouraged the believers to exhibit such\nlifestyle (Hebrews 13:2). Believers should learn to show respect and hospitality to people\nirrespective of their tribe, position, attainment or gender. It may be difficult for a\ndisrespectful person to be hospitable, especially to strangers like Lot did. Christians should\nlearn from the example of Lot by being hospitable to people whether or not they are\nstrangers.

In verse 13, the angels finally revealed their mission of destruction to the\ncity of Sodom, and urged Lot to get his relatives out of the city in a hurry. The next morning,\nthe angels said to Lot, \u201cHurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you\nwill be swept away when the city is punished.\u201d (v. 15) Lot was hesitant leaving the city of\nSodom probably because of his great possessions. The Lord, however, was merciful to him\nthat the two men forcefully helped him, his wife and two daughters to escape from the city.\nThe tone of the men showed how urgent and serious the message was. They said to him,\n\u201cFlee for your lives! Don\\'t look back, and don\\'t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the\nmountain or you will be swept away.\u201d (v. 17)\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Lot should be commended for his righteous living. Even though he lived among\nunrighteous people, he did not compromise his faith in God. He lived his life according to\nExodus 23:2 which says, \"Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong....\" This probably\nprompted the angels to inform him of their mission to the city and offered him and his\nhousehold an escape from the destruction. The angels made sure Lot and his household\nescaped before the city and its people were destroyed. Undoubtedly, they enjoyed the\nmercy of God like Noah who received the favour of God with his family when the entire\nhuman race was destroyed by flood. Christians should be reminded that the wrath of God\nwill surely come upon the wicked. Only those who have been declared righteous by the\nLord Jesus will escape. Therefore, we should stand out and abhor every form of wickedness in the society. We should speak against it and like Abraham, we should intercede on behalf\nof sinners for the salvation of their souls.

His reason for the alternative was the safety of his life. He pleaded and said to the\nangels, \u201cLook, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it\u2026.\u201d (v.\n20) Interestingly, his request was granted but with the condition to make haste. The\ncities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with burning sulphur and the entire plain\nincluding all the inhabitants and vegetation. Sad enough, the land that had been known\nto be fertile became desolate (Genesis 13:10). Worse still, Lot\\'s wife looked back against\nthe instruction of the angels and she became a pillar of salt. Certainly, her action\nindicated that she was not willing to leave the city of Sodom.

Despite the warning not to look back (v. 17), she doubted and\ndisobeyed the instruction. According to verse 26, she turned into a pillar of salt as the\npunishment of her disobedience.

Annually, he took his family to\nShiloh (a religious centre for the Israelites) to worship and make sacrifices to Yahweh (1\nSamuel 1:1-8). According to verse 9, one day, after their meal at Shiloh, Hannah was\ngreatly depressed and wept bitterly as she prayed to the Lord (vv. 9-10). Meanwhile, Eli\nthe priest was sitting in his place at the door watching with keen interest what she was\ndoing. As Hannah prayed, she made a vow saying, \"O LORD Almighty, if you will only look\nupon your servant\\'s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a\nson, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used\non his head.\" (v. 11) The implication of Hannah\\'s vow is that she shall dedicate the child to the Lord, as a Nazarite until the day of his death. Consequently, he will not take any\nintoxicating wine and never shall his hair be cut (Numbers 6:5). Such a vow made by\nHannah was to be kept throughout Samuel\\'s lifetime.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The importance of prayer in the affairs of humankind cannot be overemphasised.\nThere are several instances in the Bible when God intervened in the lives of women who\nwere barren and they became mothers of heroes of faith. Sarah the mother of Isaac,\nManoah\\'s wife the mother of Samson, Elizabeth the mother of John the Baptist and\nsome women in our present age are examples as well. Though Hannah was depressed as\na result of her childlessness, she knew prayer is the only key to overcoming the\nchallenge. The Scripture admonishes that in whatever situation we find ourselves, we\nshould cast our burden on the LORD and He shall sustain us; He shall never permit the\nrighteous to be moved. (Psalms 55:22) Even though Hannah\\'s prayer was silent, it was\nfrom a sincere heart offered through faith in God who answer prayers.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the various responses\/reactions to waiting couples and how they can\novercome them. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What was the essence of Hannah\\'s vow to God? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Eli\\'s Misconception Corrected 1 Samuel 1:12-18<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Over the years, some people\\'s good intentions have been mistaken for evil like the case\nof Hannah. Verse 12 says that Hannah continued to pray to God for a long time while Eli\nthe priest watched her. Obviously, Eli had no idea what Hannah was doing because she\nprayed silently with only her lips moving (vv. 12-14). Therefore, Eli got the wrong\nimpression and assumed that Hannah was drunk because drinking was a part of some\nreligious festivals in Israel (Judges 9:27; 21:20-21). In other words, he thought Hannah\nwas under the influence of alcohol. He was, however, quick to express his misconception\nto her but Hannah humbly clarified herself and replied Eli in verses 15-16 thus:<ol>\n<li>I am a woman who is deeply troubled;<\/li>\n<li>I have not been drinking wine or beer;<\/li>\n<li>I was only pouring my soul in prayers to God;<\/li>\n<li>Do not confuse me for a wicked woman;<\/li>\n<li>I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Eli\\'s response to Hannah was amazing after she had clarified herself.

She believed her\nprayers will be answered, just like Mary, the mother of Jesus who had faith that what the\nangel had said will come to pass (Luke 1:38).<\/p>\n<p>The world we live in is characterised by people who sometimes misunderstand and\nconclude that people\\'s predicaments are as a result of their sins.

She conceived and gave birth\nto a male child just as she had requested from the Lord.

Hannah prayed to God out of a\ndesperate heart, specifically requesting for a male child and God granted her request\naccordingly. God still answers the prayers of those who have faith in Him. The psalmist\naffirms the ever-ready nature of God to answer the prayers of His people in distress; thus\nhe could say, \u201cI call on the LORD in my distress, and he answers me.\" (Psalm 120:1) God is\nsensitive to the pains of those who trust and approach Him for help in their distress.\nIrrespective of what they might be going through, believers should not trivialise prayers.\nWhenever the people of God take their cases to God in prayers, God answers them.

They grumbled against Moses and\nAaron and even preferred to have remained in Egypt than to die in the desert as a result of\nhunger. Interestingly, God heard their cry and was moved with passion. He miraculously\nprovided bread from heaven to satisfy the people.<\/p>\n<p>Famine or food shortage has always posed a serious problem to humanity. It can lead\nto starvation, frustration, dejection, murmuring and sometimes loss of lives. A typical\nexample is the famine that besieged Samaria, which lasted long to the extent that the\nhead of a donkey was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods\nfor five shekels (2 Kings 6:24-25). However, today\\'s lesson is a reminder that God is our\nProvider.

On the fifteenth day of the\nsecond month after they were delivered from Egypt, the whole community moved from\nElim towards Mount Sinai. Unfortunately, there was shortage of drinking water because\nthey were in the desert. According to verse 3, they remembered their \"supposed good old\ndays\" in Egypt when they ate at will. Therefore, they murmured against their leaders (Moses\nand Aaron) saying, \u201cIf only we had died by the Lord\\'s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots\nof meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve\nthis entire assembly to death.\u201d Obviously, the people started to lose hope when they\nremembered the continual provision of food they had in Egypt. Thus, they accused Moses\nand Aaron of intentionally bringing them into the wilderness to starve them to death.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Israel was a nation that easily forgot God\\'s faithfulness. His miraculous dealings with\nthem from the time they were delivered from their slave masters in Egypt to the crossing of\nthe Red Sea and the provision of water was soon forgotten. They forgot God\u2019s ability to\nsolve their numerous problems. Worse still, their expression in verse 3 reveals their preference of Egypt where they had choices of food like vegetables and fish, even though\nwith hard labour. They grumbled and accused their leaders of purposely causing them\nhunger. Some believers in the contemporary time can be likened to the people of Israel.\nThey complain and easily forget God\\'s faithfulness, especially when they are faced with\nlife\\'s challenges. They begin to doubt and devalue God\\'s power to work miracles like He did\nin the past.

According to verse 17, Moses\\'\ninstruction was, \u201cGo up through the Negev and on into the hill country.\u201d This implies that\na thorough investigation should be carried out during which data would be carefully\ncollated for analysis that would determine their decision to truly go and inhabit the land.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What was the mission of the spies to Canaan? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the place of instruction(s) in carrying out an assignment.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>What would you say is the benefit(s) of this approach to achieving God\\'s purpose for\nbelievers today?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Reports of the Spies Numbers 13:25-28a<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The spies embarked on the mission to explore the land of Canaan. The terms of\nreference probably were: to carry out a survey of the land; its fertility, population, and its\nfortification (vv. 18-20). In addition, they were to assess the strengths and weaknesses of\nthe people (v. 18). Having spent forty days in the exploration, they returned to Moses,\nAaron and the whole community of Israel in the wilderness of Paran. Their report was based on what they saw and it gave credence to the fertility of the land (Exodus 3:8). To\nfurther convince Moses, Aaron and the people of the goodness of the land; they said,\n\u201cWe went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here\nis its fruit.\" (v. 27) The following was their report:<ol>\n<li>The people who live there are very powerful;<\/li>\n<li>The cities are large and well fortified;<\/li>\n<li>The descendants of Anak are in the land.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>In their comparison, they presumed themselves to be grasshoppers before the\nCanaanites (v. 33) which, to them, would make it difficult to possess the land. As a result,\nthey were discouraged from proceeding with their journey.<\/p>\n<p>The major problem of the people of Israel was fear and faithlessness in God. They were\npessimistic in their report. They lost hope in God and His power to do what He has promised\namong the people. In spite of God\\'s repeated reminder that the land has been given to them,\nthey failed to believe, though there was enough convincing evidence about the goodness of\nthe land during their exploration, they doubted the possibility of them possessing the land.\nBelievers should avoid being pessimistic about the promises of God because we can be\ndeprived of our blessings. We should not be overwhelmed by life\\'s challenges to the extent of\nbeing skeptical about what God can do.

While two gave positive report, the other ten concluded that they were unable\nto possess the land based on what they saw. This report put fear and doubt in the hearts\nof the people and they wanted to choose another leader who will lead them back to\nEgypt (vv. 1-4). According to the passage, the people wept profusely and grumbled\nagainst Moses and Aaron (vv. 1-2). They alleged that God intended to bring them to the\nland in order to destroy them so that their wives and children will be captured (vv. 2-4).\nMoses and Aaron threw themselves to the ground apparently as an intercession to God\non behalf of the people. Nevertheless, Joshua and Caleb spoke with courage and faith in\nGod\\'s ability to give them the land and defeat their enemies as He had done to the god of\nthe Egyptians (v. 8; Exodus 18:12).They warned the people saying:\"Only do not rebel\nagainst the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will swallow\nthem up. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them.\" (v. 9) Unfortunately, the encouraging words were ignored by the people who also attempted\nto stone them to death but the dazzling light of the LORD\u2019s presence appeared and\ncovered the tent (v. 10).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The Israelites were short-sighted in their view of the land and God\\'s power to conquer the\nland. Instead of them to have faith in God who promised to give them the land, they only focused\non the physical hurdles. They began to spread false report among themselves about the land\nthey had explored. It is an indication that the people only walked by sight and not by faith; thus\nthey grumbled against their leaders, Moses and Aaron. Although God heard the cry of Moses\nand Aaron, the effect of Israel\u2019s faithlessness led to God\\'s declaration that the rebellious\ngeneration will not enter the Promised Land (vv. 21-23). Many believers today find themselves in\nsuch error of unbelief. The challenge from the lesson is that we should not walk by sight but by\nfaith in keeping our relationship with God so we can enjoy His promised blessings.

He Gwas known for his rebellious acts from his secondary school days when his issues\nwere brought before his parents from time to time. Apart from being defiant, George\nwas a thief, a liar and very cunning. Each time he stole in school or the community, his mother\nwould plead on his behalf and sometimes refund the stolen items. He became so notorious to\nthe extent that he led his gang to rob several houses and banks in the community and carted\naway their valuables. He also killed as many people who did not cooperate with his gang in the\ncourse of their robbery operation. George was indeed a hardened criminal and had been\ndeclared wanted in the society. His mother repeatedly interceded for him with the hope that\nsomeday, her son will repent and receive God\\'s forgiveness. One day, George woke up with a\nburden in his heart and he started to cry when he thought of his sinful lifestyle. However, his\nfear was: \\'Will God forgive my numerous sins?\\' He was led to a pastor who told him about the\nsaving and forgiving power of God to sinners, notwithstanding the magnitude of their sins.\nEventually, George had the assurance of the forgiveness of his sins and he became zealous in\nthe things of God.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>God forgives sins and restores, irrespective of its magnitude. The case of the Israelites who\nmurmured and sinned against God repeatedly can attest to this fact. Today\\'s lesson is an\nexample of God\\'s acts of forgiveness to the Israelites after Moses interceded on their behalf,\nusing the same argument he had used in Mount Sinai (Exodus 32:11-14)<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>God\\'s Plan to Destroy Israel Numbers 14:10b-12<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Last week, we studied that Israel\\'s unbelief made them to rebel against God because of\nthe different reports about the Promised Land and its possession. The majority who\nbelieved the discouraging reports about their inability to possess the land attempted to\nstone Joshua and Caleb to death but for God\\'s intervention and the presence of the Lord\nwhich became mightily visible among them (v. 10b). Then God spoke to Moses about\nIsrael\\'s repeated unbelief, despite His miracles among them (v. 11). He said, \u201cHow long\nwill this people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe me, inspite\nof all the miraculous signs among them?\u201d He thereafter expressed His plan to smite\nthem with a plague, with a promise to make a great and strong nation through Moses (v.\n12). The nation of Israel is a prototype of this present generation that is already\ncharacterised by wickedness and dishonour for God, despite His faithfulness to us.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It is evident that the nation of Israel could not sustain a steady relationship with God\nfrom the time they left Egypt. Their life was characterised by grumbling against God and\nHis servants without taking into remembrance His miraculous deeds among them. Their\nunbelief was a matter of concern to God; thus He resolved to inflict them with a disease\nand finally destroy them. Unbelief and lack of trust in God is sin against Him and they can\nhinder us from receiving God\\'s promised blessings. As believers, we should not forget God\\'s faithfulness or doubt His ability to bless and deliver, no matter the challenges we\nare faced with. Similarly, the gift of salvation, which is God\\'s promise to humankind\nthrough Jesus Christ, requires faith (Romans 10:9-13). In other words, it is only those\nwho have faith in Christ that will partake of the salvation and be rewarded with eternal\nlife (John 3:16-18).<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Describe God\\'s reaction to destroy the people of Israel as a result of their\nunbelief.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss some of the common ways Christians show contempt to God today and how\nto curb it.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Moses Intercedes for Israel Numbers 14:13-19<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Moses knew that God meant His plan to destroy the people of Israel. Therefore, he\ninterceded on their behalf. He opposed God\\'s plan by using the same argument he used\nat Mount Sinai (Exodus 32:11-14). He was concerned about the people and what the\nEgyptians and Canaanites who had heard about the kind acts of God among the people\nwould say. Affirmatively, he declared that the other nations would despise God that He\nhad lost His strength to lead Israel into the land, which He had promised; hence He\ndestroyed them in the wilderness (vv. 13-16). Subsequently, Moses reminded God of His\nattributes: He is slow to anger (v. 17); generous in love; and He forgives sin and rebellion.\nHe earnestly prayed that God should consider His great love and forgive the sin of the\nIsraelites as He has always done (v. 19).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Moses was a true leader. He understood the task of leadership; thus, he was able to\nplay the role of an intermediary between Israel and God. Even though the people of\nIsrael were a source of frustration to him, he still interceded for them. Little wonder he is\ndescribed as pre-Christ whose role among the Israelites prepared the world for the\nmediatory role of Christ as the Saviour of humankind (John 3:15; 1 John 2:2). He\ninterceded on behalf of the children of Israel just as Jesus became the Deliverer of\nhumankind from eternal destruction.

God heard the plea of Moses and acted on it by forgiving the people their sins. He said to him, \u201cI have forgiven them, as you asked.\u201d The Lord, however, told Moses\nthat the men who participated in the rebellion will be punished; they will not enter the\nPromised Land, which He swore to give to their forefathers, except Caleb and Joshua\nwho followed Him whole-heartedly (vv. 21-24, 30). Although the punishment will not be\nin form of utter destruction, they would die in the wilderness one after the other.

God spoke through Moses; instructing\nthe people to adhere to His commands. He said to them, \u201cHear now, O Israel, the decrees I am\nabout to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the\nland that the LORD, the God of your forefathers, is giving you.\u201d Remarkably, there was a warning in\nverse 2 not to add or take away from the commands but to keep them as they were. Similarly,\nthere is a warning not to add or take away anything from the book of prophecy (Revelation 22:17-\n18). Consequently, the people of Israel were encouraged to remember what God did at Baal-Peor\nwhere about 24,000 people died as a result of their unfaithfulness (Numbers 25:1-9). Without\ndoubt, the challenge was a direct appeal to the memory of the Israelites who were to keep the\nLaws because of the greatness of God\\'s revelation.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The Mosaic law was given to the nation of Israel not to be a burden, but to distinguish\nIsrael from all other nations by making her wise, great and consecrated to their holy God. It\nwas a code or rule of life for the Israelites; hence, the directive not to add or take anything\naway from it (Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32; Revelation 22:18-19). This warning was instructive\nbecause the revelation the Lord gives through His Word is sufficient for life. Therefore, all of\nit must be strictly adhered to. The implication of Moses\\' emphasis on \u201cstatutes,\u201d and\n\u201cordinances\u201d was an indication that there was no alternative for the people of Israel. This is\nthe reason for the reference in verse 3; he reminded them that those who contravened\nGod\\'s commandments died at Baal-Peor (Moab), while the faithful are still alive. The\nrepetition was meant to serve as deterrent. However, what is most important to Christians\nis the Law of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:11), though both the Old and the New laws are\nprofitable to people of all ages (1 Timothy 1:8-10; 2 Timothy 3:16).<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the consequences of disobeying God\\'s laws.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Why was Israel told repeatedly to obey God\\'s laws and what is the implication for\nbelievers? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>How do these commandments affect Christians today? <\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Reminder to Keep the Commandments Deuteronomy 4:5-8<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Moses recounted the history of God\\'s dealings with Israel over the past forty years and the\nneed to keep His laws as they prepared to possess the Promised Land. He declared in verse 5\nhow he had taught them the laws and decrees according to the LORD\u2019S command so that they\nwill be able to follow them in the land they were entering to possess. He was definite in verse\n6 when he commanded the people to observe the laws carefully. The reason for the\nadmonition is that their obedience will reveal their wisdom and understanding to the\nnations that will hear about the decrees and say, \u201cSurely, this great nation is a wise and\nunderstanding people.\u201d (v. 6b) Supposedly, their obedience to God\\'s command should\nattract neighbouring nations in the Promised Land. After all, no other nation with their\ngreatness has a God who is near when they need Him like our LORD God who answers us\nwhenever we pray. To further remind them of the need to keep the commandments, Moses\nadded that no other nation has such righteous decrees and laws like he has taught them;\nthus the admonition to be on guard and make sure they did not forget what they have seen\nas long as they live (v. 9).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Moses\\' emphasis was that every aspect of the commandments should be kept and no\nportion of it should be underrated. He affirmed that faithful observance of the laws, which he\nhad taught them (Israel) would portray them as a wise and understanding people to other\nnations. They were expected to be faithful in obedience to the laws and pass them on to the\nupcoming generation. Unfortunately, Israel forgot God\\'s righteous laws and decrees. They\nwere influenced by their neighgbouring nations and so were repeatedly led to the worship of\nthe Canaanite gods. God\\'s reminder to the Israelites to keep the commandments is also\napplicable to contemporary Christians because they will guide us in our relationship with God\nand one another. In fact, today\\'s lesson is a reminder that we are under obligation to keep\nGod\\'s commandments faithfully so that we can influence our generation and be blessed.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What steps can the church take to ensure that members obey God\\'s\ncommandments?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What makes the laws of Christ better than the laws of the Jews?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Call Not to Forget God\\'s Commandments Deuteronomy 4:12-13<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Moses\\' encounter with God at Mount Sinai during which the Ten Commandments was given\nto the Israelites in their preparation to enter the Promised Land was an era in the history of\nIsrael that will never be forgotten. Moses admonished the people to remember the day they stood before the Lord their God at Horeb to hear His words so that they may reverence Him\nand teach them to their children (v. 10). The LORD spoke to the assembly from the fire but\nthey did not see any human form. He, however, told them what they must do to keep the\ncovenant relationship He made with them and to keep the Ten Commandments. Never the\nless, it should be noted that Israel never doubted the words of God and as many who heard\nHim believed in His manifestation.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The benefits of obeying God\\'s commands cannot be over-emphasised. Obedience is\nthe key to enjoying the blessings of God; hence, God repeatedly reminded Israel to keep His\ncommandments and covenant when they finally possess the land. This admonition should\nserve as a warning to us today not to misbehave so that we will live exemplary lives;\ndemonstrate obedient faith in our relationship with Him. Even today, God constantly calls us\nto remember His covenant relationship with us through the blood of Jesus, which was shed\nfor the remission of sins of humankind. Whenever we act contrary to the commandments of\nGod, it brings about negative consequences.

According to the pastor, the purpose was to\nencourage members who may be going through challenges to trust God for their\nbreakthrough. One of the most exciting testimonies was the one shared by a civil servant\nwho had made a vow to bless the three pastors in his church with a pair of suit each,\nevery year. Interestingly, he had done it consistently for a period of five years.\nUnfortunately, because of delay in payment of salary, he had no means of buying the\nsuits last year.

Truly, the lesson is a reminder that God rewards\nfaithfulness. The case of the widow of Zarephath whose miracle of provision is still a\npoint of reference till today is remarkable.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Elijah\\'s Request 1 Kings 17:8-12<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The name Elijah literally means \\'Yahweh is God\\'. When Baal worship threatened to\nexterminate the worship of Yahweh in Israel, Elijah made King Ahab know that Jehovah is\nthe Living God, and he was the messenger sent from Him. As he was chased away from\nthe city, God guided him to the Brook of Cherith, where he drank water from and was fed\nby ravens with bread twice daily (1 Kings 17:1-6).When the brook dried up, God sent\nElijah to the city of Zarephath in order to be fed by a certain widow whose name is not\nmentioned. Interestingly, the widow was at the city gate, gathering sticks when the man\nof God, said to her, \u201cWould you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?\u201d and\nas she was going to get it, Elijah added, \u201cAnd bring me, please, a piece of bread.\u201d\nObviously, Elijah recognised the woman as the widow who God said He had commanded\nto supply him food (v. 9). Notable in the passage is the fact that the woman was sincere in\nher response to the prophet. \u201cAs surely as the LORD your God lives\u201d, she replied, \u201cI don\\'t\nhave any bread only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few\nsticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son that we my eat it and die.\u201d (v.\n12) From all indications, God would have prepared the woman to meet the needs of the\nprophet, even though she may not be aware of the divine assignment.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It is clear from the passage that the widow was very humble, industrious and\ncompassionate. The sincerity of her expression in verse 12 of the inadequate flour and oil, which was reserved for herself and her only son before they die was an indication\nthat she was straightforward in her response to Elijah. Therefore, we can say that it was\nGod\\'s will to use the weak and foolish things of this world to bring honour to Him. Elijah\nwas sent to the woman that he might still live upon providence as much as he did when\nthe ravens fed him. This is a great challenge to the contemporary Christians to put God\nfirst in everything they do, irrespective of their situation. It reminds us of Matthew 6:33,\nwhich enjoins us to \u201cseek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all other things will\nbe added as well\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why did Elijah ask for food and drink from a Gentile woman, in spite of their age-long\nhostility? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>If you were the widow, what would have been your response to Elijah, especially in\nthe midst of insufficiency?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Describe the man Elijah, in relation to the passage .<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Widow\\'s Kind Response 1 Kings 17:13-16<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The dialogue between Elijah and the widow is noteworthy. The prophet certainly knew\nthat the woman was afraid based on her expression in verse 12; thus he decided to douse\nher fear. He said to her, \u201cDon\\'t be afraid\u2026.\u201d He commanded her to go and prepare a meal\nfor him first and then make the rest for herself and her only son. According to verse 13, in\nhis attempt to further douse her fear, Elijah reminded her of God\\'s promise that, \\'The jar\nof flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD gives\nrain on the land. \\'Ultimately, the woman demonstrated faith and went and did as the\nprophet had commanded and the LORD miraculously provided food every day for Elijah,\nthe woman and her son. In accordance with the word of the LORD , which was spoken\nthrough Elijah, the jar of flour did not run dry neither, did the jug of oil run dry. Indeed, it\nwas a recompense for the widow and her son for meeting the needs of the prophet.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>It is glaring that Elijah and the widow both demonstrated total obedience to God\\'s command.\nPrincipally, she demonstrated faith and showed generosity in her effort to satisfy the man of\nGod, even though she did not have enough because of the famine that besieged Israel at that\ntime. Little wonder Jesus made reference to her faith (Luke 4:23-28). Indeed, she merited a\nprophet\\'s reward, and divine abundance, which are the benefits of doing good. The Scripture\naffirms that the righteous shall not be ashamed in the evil times, and in the days of famine they\nshall be satisfied (Psalm 37:19). This was the case of the widow, who cared for the man of God\nand thereafter received God\\'s divine providence. The challenge, therefore, is that those who\nconfidently put their trust in God, and practice sacrificial giving will ever live in abundance.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What was the significance of Elijah\\'s movement to Zarephath?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What is your assessment of the response of the widow to the man of God,\nElijah?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Discuss the importance of obedience in relation to Elijah and the\nwidow.<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Thank God for meeting your needs on daily basis.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Ask for faith and grace to always meet the needs of people around you to the glory of God.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Pray against fear and the grace to always obey God\\'s command.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Identify someone in the church or community who needs help and find a way of\nmeeting his\/her needs.<\/li>\n<li>Pray and plan on how your church can be involved in the ministry of the\nunderprivileged.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Believers should rely on God for their daily needs.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Those who give shall not lack anything good.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Total obedience to God is the key to receiving divine blessings.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>God expects us to be kind and generous to one another.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>God is capable of meeting our needs.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":42,"title":"faith can heal","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>October 20, 2019<\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>FAITH CAN HEAL<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:James 5:13-18<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Luke 7:1-10<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you.\nBut say the word; and my servant will be healed.<b>Luke 7:7<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Define faith and its importance to\nhealing.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Share the benefits of persistence in\nprayers as displayed by the elders in this\npassage in line with Jesus\\' teaching in\nLuke 18:ff.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Suggest different ways Christians can\ndevelop their faith in Jesus Christ for\nhealing.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n<li>Write down their determination to\napproach God in prayer with confidence in\nHis power to answer prayers.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Mrs Smith Adeogo and her family members are devoted Christians.

It\nshould be noted that the man in today\\'s lesson demonstrated great faith when he sought\nthe help of Jesus for one of his servants who was sick, and the servant\\'s health was\nrestored by the power of Jesus.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Centurion\\'s Request Luke 7:1-5<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>In chapter 6 of Luke, Jesus taught many lessons about the kingdom. He ended it with the\nimportance of complete obedience to His teaching, using the parable of the two\nbuilders, after which He proceeded to Capernaum. According to verse 2, a Roman officer\n(a Centurion in charge of about one hundred Roman troops) had a sick servant who was\nvaluable to him. Certainly, the centurion had heard about Jesus and perhaps His power\nto heal and deliver. Therefore, because of his concern for his ill servant, he sent some\nJewish elders to ask Jesus to come and heal him (v. 3). The centurion was not alone in his\ndesire for the sick servant to be healed and Jesus\\' ability to do so. Obviously, the elders\nhe sent had a similar opinion and belief; thus they begged Jesus with great passion. The\nelders demonstrated commitment to the assignment as they pleaded with Jesus\nearnestly saying, \u201cThis man deserves to have you do this\u2026 (v. 4). They stressed two\nreasons why Jesus should honour the invitation of the centurion: he loved their nation\n and had built their synagogue in Capernaum (Mark 1:21-23) the same synagogue\nwhere Jesus had often taught and healed the sick. By this singular act, the Centurion\nshowed his respect for the God of Israel, the Jewish nation and religion.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>There is no doubt that the faith and pleas of these elders show the efficacy of\npersistence in prayer. It also portrays the benefit of a collective willingness, faith and\nbelief in Jesus\\' power to heal the sick and deliver the demon-possessed. This stresses the\nneed for unity among believers to pray and intercede on behalf of others, especially in\ntheir trying moments. The desire of the Centurion to have his servant healed is\nnoteworthy. This must have been based on the usefulness of the servant and his\nobedience to his master. He also loved the Jewish nation and their religion. As a result, he\nbuilt a place of worship for them as an act of love for God and His people.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why is it that some leaders do not have regard for the well-being of their followers,\nunlike the centurion in today\\'s passage?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>How can Christians promote a good working relationship among themselves?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Share the benefits of persistence in prayer as displayed by the elders in this\npassage.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Centurion\\'s Faith and Humility Luke 7:6-8<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The Jewish elders successfully convinced Jesus of the personality and generosity of the\nCenturion and perhaps how much respect he has for the Jewish faith. Thereafter, Jesus was\nmoved with compassion and immediately went with them to the Centurion\\'s house. When\nhe saw Jesus afar off, the Centurion recognised his unworthiness to receive Jesus into his\nhome. He simply sent a message to Him saying, \u201cLord, do not trouble yourself, for I do not\ndeserve to have you come under my roof\u201d, hence I did not bother to come to you personally.\nHe demonstrated faith and said, \u201c\u2026but say the word and my servant will be healed.\u201d (vv. 6b-\n7) This, of course, was a sign of humility and faith on the part of the Centurion who thought\nof himself less but had much regard for Jesus. After all, he was a man of authority who had\nsoldiers serving under him who obey his instructions without questioning his order. In fact,\nit was uncommon for a Roman officer to feel undeserving of a Jewish Rabbi this way. Truly,\nthe Centurion displayed a remarkable faith by seeing a parallel in the way he commanded\nhis soldiers and the word of Jesus. Even though he had initially requested for Him to come,\nhe believed that Jesus\\' pronouncement alone would make his servant well (vv. 3, 7) and it\nhappened according to his faith (v. 10). In other words, Jesus did not have to be physically\npresent before His words could accomplish what He purposed. In the same manner,\nChristians do not need the physical presence of Christ before their needs are met. All we\nrequire is a step of faith in Christ to receive our miracle.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The Centurion\\'s reverence for God was translated into his reverence and high\nesteem for Jesus. While the Jewish elders said the centurion was worthy of Jesus\\' help (v.\n4), he claimed he was unworthy to receive Him into his house (v. 6).

He acknowledged the fact that Jesus\\'\nauthority and power was supreme and divine to heal his servant, even from a distance. Our\nLord Jesus Christ was pleased with the faith and confession of the Centurion. Jesus\nhonoured him and said to His followers, \u201cI tell you, I have not found such great faith even in\nIsrael.\u201d (v. 9) In other words, Jesus was pleased with his faith, humility, simplicity and\nsincere confession, notwithstanding his position. The climax of the story is that before the\nelders returned home, the health of the servant had been completely restored (v. 10).This\nis an indication that faith (belief), intercession and persistence are important factors to\nreceiving miracles anywhere. Little wonder Jesus could not perform many miracles in His\nhometown, Nazareth because of their unbelief!\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The writer of Hebrews defines faith as being certain about the things we hope for or\nthe things we cannot see (Hebrews 11:1). Therefore the role of faith in both physical and\nspiritual healing cannot be over-emphasised as displayed by the Centurion in today\\'s\npassage. In addition, Jesus\\' concern for the Centurion and his servant shows that the\nGentiles are not excluded from the benefit of His grace.

From time to time, her\nchildren were molested and despised by their neighbours because of their mother\\'s\nshameful behaviour. Unfortunately, the children\\'s effort to correct and lead their mother\nto Christ proved unsuccessful, but they continued to pray for her salvation. After\nsometime, one of the churches in the community organised a crusade and to the\namazement of everyone, the woman gave her life to Christ and began to live a new life.\nShe was warmly received into the fellowship of other believers, who accepted her\nwithout minding her past. Everyone who heard was surprised while some gave their lives\nto Christ through her testimony. This is like the case of the Samaritan woman who met\nJesus by the side of the well. Although her past was terrible, her testimony eventually\nopened the way of salvation for the Samaritans to come to Jesus (John 4:28-30).<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>God wants His children to have faith that saves just like the faith of the sinner in\ntoday\\'s lesson.

One day, one of them named Simon\ninvited Jesus Christ to a meal in his house probably to test Him as it was their habit.\nDefinitely, the news of Jesus\\' presence in the home of the Pharisee would have spread\nround town. Thus, a woman who had been living a sinful life came to Him with an\nalabaster jar of ointment or perfume. According to the Jewish culture, people do not\nusually sit at tables but recline on low couches, leaning on the left arm with their head\ntowards the table while their feet stretched backward without sandals. That possibly\nmade it easily for the woman to approach Jesus with the following actions:<ol>\n<li>She stood at Jesus\\' feet weeping;<\/li>\n<li>She wet His feet with her tears probably to cleanse the dusts on His sandals, having\nwalked on a dusty road;<\/li>\n<li>She wiped them with her hair and kissed Him as a mark of respect for a distinguished\nRabbi;<\/li>\n<li>She anointed Jesus\\' feet with an expensive perfume.<\/li>\n<\/ol>It is possible that the woman did all these to Jesus to appreciate Him and show her desire\nfor a new life because sin had dented her image and integrity.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>From the account of this woman, we can say that one has a role to play before a\nremarkable change can take place in one\\'s life. The woman\\'s situation was bad and she was\nnot in any way able to help herself. Interestingly, she found a rare privilege in Christ who was\ninvited to a dinner by Simon the Pharisee (v. 36). She quickly grabbed the opportunity,\nidentified with Jesus, acknowledged her sinful nature and practically demonstrated her\nwillingness to turn around. The expression of her kind-heartedness was acceptable to Jesus,\neven though the Pharisees had described her as a sinner (v. 39).<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why did Jesus accept the invitation of a Pharisee to eat in his house?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What do you think could have motivated the woman to anoint Jesus\\' feet with such an\nexpensive perfume?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Why is it difficult for some people to seek help openly like the woman in today\\'s\nlesson?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Sinful Woman Receives Forgiveness Luke 7:40-48<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Having watched carefully the action of the woman towards Jesus, the Pharisee reacted\nnegatively. He said to himself, \u201cIf this man [Jesus] were a prophet, he would know who is\ntouching him and what kind of a woman she is, that she is a sinner.\u201d (v. 39) Obviously, the\nstatement was a reflection of his shallow knowledge and ignorance of the personality of\nJesus Christ. It also shows his pride, hypocrisy and indifference, even though he was the\nhost, he never expected the woman to identify with Jesus for any reason. However, he\nhad not spoken further when Jesus responded to his thoughts and justified the woman\\'s\naction as one who deserves forgiveness. He gave an illustration of the two forgiven\ndebtors (vv. 40-47). Ultimately, Jesus declared that her many sins have been forgiven\nbecause she has shown Him much love (v. 48). This is a similar response to Jesus\\'\ndeclaration about the man with palsy (Luke 5:17-26; Matthew 9:1) whose many sins\nwere forgiven. Thereafter, Jesus contrasted the attitude of the woman with that of His\nhost, Simon who did not show affection to Him, despite the fact that he was His host.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Apparently, Simon doubted Jesus\\' ability, especially as a prophet to know that the\nwoman was a sinner, whereas Jesus, being divine, knew that the woman was a sinner.\nThus He proved Simon wrong and further approved of the woman\\'s kind-heartedness\ntowards Him as against Simon\\'s behaviour (vv. 44-48). Therefore, He affirmed her good\ndeeds and declared that her many sins have been forgiven. Remarkably, the woman\nknew her problem and where to seek solution. Therefore, irrespective of the feelings of\nthe people about her, she did not hesitate to go to Jesus. She demonstrated her faith in\nJesus to save. The challenge is that instead of grudging \\'greater\\' sinners for finding\nabundant mercy with Christ, we should examine our lives and seek to receive\nforgiveness from Jesus who is always ready to forgive repentant sinners.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>1.

He turned to\nthe woman and said, \u201cYour faith has saved you; go in peace.\u201d (v. 50) The woman\\'s\nexpression of sorrow for sin, and love for Christ were the effects and products of her faith.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Apparently, Jesus was impressed and He appreciated the woman\\'s good deeds.\nHowever, we must note that the woman\\'s action was not an act of bribery to receive\nJesus\\' forgiveness after all, God cannot be bribed or enticed.

He designed a form with various sections, which every member was\nmade to complete. According to the pastor, the purpose was to ascertain their spiritual\nmaturity and how they can be assisted to improve. The exercise further revealed that\nwhile some members did not have genuine salvation experience, others lacked\ncommitment and valued their personal interest over advancing the cause of the Gospel.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Spiritual self-examination is the act of taking a careful look at one\\'s life often, to see if\none is living a life that is worthy and pleasing to God. The need to do regular selfexamination\nis fundamental because it will serve as the spiritual tool to help guide one to\nbe faithful to God. In our passage today, Apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Corinth,\nasking them to examine themselves to see if they are still in the faith. This was preceded\nby a warning to detest sin.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Necessary Warning 2 Corinthians 13:1-4<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Paul was the founder of the church in Corinth. He had made a second visit to the\nchurch to deal with some developing crisis of Christian life, faith and division among the\nbrethren. The second letter was written to warn the Christians that he will definitely\ncarry out disciplinary action against offenders when he comes to them the third time.\nTherefore, prior to his third visit, he wrote a letter and made clear to them some of his\nsteps in addressing the lingering crisis: For example, he said:<ol>\n<li>One or two witnesses according to the Scripture will establish every accusation.<\/li>\n<li>In line with his initial warning, those who have sinned in the past and others will not\nescape punishment. Eventually, they will have the evidence they need that he has\nauthority and Christ Jesus speaks through him as an apostle to correct and deal with\nsinners.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>He added that Christ is not weak in dealing with them but powerful among them.\nThough He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God (v. 4). Similarly, Paul\nconfessed that they are also weak in union with Him, yet by the power of God they will\nlive with Him to serve the people of Corinth. In other words, if any of them thinks Paul is\nweak, they will soon know that Christ who speaks through him is not weak but powerful.<\/p>\n<p>Paul\\'s concern for the Corinthian believers in the passage is obvious. He founded the\nchurch and perhaps had nurtured them and so, he would not allow them to go astray\notherwise; his labour would be in vain. So, he spoke frankly and with pastoral authority that every matter they have been alleged of will be validated by two to three trusted\nwitnesses. After all, they have heard the truth that God hates sin, and he has warned\nthem to abstain from it (v. 2b). For this reason, contemporary believers must heed Paul\\'s\nwarning and strive daily to live holy lives. Because punishment awaits sinners, the\nchurch must take a stand to preach to sinners to repent and become members of the\nbody of Christ who are expected to live sinless lives. We should be reminded that it is\nGod\\'s will that all His children live holy lives and that sinners be converted through the\npower of Christ Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why do you think it was necessary for Paul to validate every matter with the\ntestimony of more than one person?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>How should the church deal with sinners in the church? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Self-Examination Encouraged 2 Corinthians 13:5-6<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Paul did not relent in his effort to help the Corinthian brethren grow to spiritual\nmaturity. Having given the warning to stay away from sin, he further enjoined them to\nexamine themselves to see if they are still in the faith. He said, \u201cExamine yourselves to see\nwhether you are in the faith; test yourselves. \"The charge was followed with a question, \u201cDo\nyou not realise that Christ Jesus is in you \u2014 unless, of course, you fail the test?\u201d (v. 5) Selfexamination,\nas it is used by Paul in the passage, simply meant that the Corinthian brethren\nshould put themselves to the test and judge their actions if they are spiritually healthy\ninstead of demanding proof that Christ is speaking through him. Even though Paul was sure\nthat Christ Jesus was in them, he prescribed self-examination because it allows everyone to\ndo a personal inward look to see if they are not entangled in the web of sin. According to\nverse 6, Paul affirmed that they (possibly the Corinthians and himself) have not failed the\ntest.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The importance of self-examination as explained by Apostle Paul in the passage is very\ngreat. He made it clear to the Corinthians that the evidence of Christ living in them can\nonly be ascertained through a careful self-examination, which is a measure to determine\nand guarantee one\\'s spiritual state. He added that, himself, having being examined, has\nnot failed the test of self-examination; proving that Christ is in him. \u201cAnd I trust that you\nwill discover that we have not failed the test.\u201d (v. 6) Paul\\'s encouragement on spiritual\nself appraisal is imperative for all believers because it will help us to know whether we\nare moving on the track of faith or have derailed. Of course, the aftermath of such\nspiritual review will challenge us to be more involved in spiritual exercises that lead to a\nhealthy spiritual life. Self-examination is so important that the Scripture says we are not\nto partake of the Lord Supper without first examining ourselves.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Does the self-examination which Paul recommended have any spiritual value to\ncontemporary Christians? <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What are the steps to be taken in order to carry out self-examination?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Prayer to Be Faithful 2 Corinthians 13:7-9<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Paul\\'s constant warning, encouragement and prayer for the brethren in Corinth\nwas borne out of his concern for them not to deviate from the truth of the Gospel. Again,\nhe saw the need to pray for the believers, hoping that they will not do anything wrong\nbut remain holy and faithful to the end. He said to them, \u201cNow we pray to God that you\nwill not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that\nyou will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.\u201d (v. 7)The implication\nof the prayer is to watch their actions daily and avoid doing anything that would bring\nshame to God. This type of prayer became necessary because of those who claim to be\nChristians but their actions negate what they profess. His expression in verse 7 is\namazing. He said, \u201cFor we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.\u201d (v.\n7) Supposedly, if the truth is acknowledged, there may be no need to take disciplinary\naction against offenders.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Ultimately, anyone who is against the cause of truth is living in sin and may need to\nexamine his\/her life and return to God in true repentance. In contrast, whoever is strong\nin Christ would not be against the truth, because Christ is TRUTH. As he concluded his\nletter, his utmost desire for the Corinthians was to see them become strong and perfect\nin Christ Jesus, even though they were weak physically (v. 9). It must be stated that just as\nPaul had desired and prayed for the believers to be firm in Christ Jesus to the end, so does\nGod want everyone to remain faithful in doing His will to the end so that no one will\nperish but that everyone would be saved.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What does Paul\\'s prayer for the brethren in Corinth teach contemporary\nChristians?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>How can we remain faithful and loyal to the cause of Christ, especially in this end time\nwhen many believers are faced with the temptation to compromise their\nfaith?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray that the Lord will help you to daily abstain from sin through the help of the Holy\nSpirit, in Jesus\\' Name.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Intercede for other believers that God would uphold them to the end and that those\nstruggling with sin would gain victory, in Jesus\\' Name.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Identify those you know who are struggling with sin but are willing to live holy lives\nand lead them to the pastoral team for further help.<\/li>\n<li>Identify like-minded believers in your church with whom you can continue to pray for\nthose who need God to help them overcome sin and live a life of holiness.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>God loves sinners but hates their sinful lifestyle.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Disciples of Christ Jesus must avoid sin and any form of godlessness.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Sinners must be reminded and warned constantly about God\\'s impending\npunishment.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>Regular self-examination can help us remain faithful.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>We should learn to pray for one another.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Christians should be ready to heed warning in order to avoid being judged and\npunished.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":45,"title":"be examples of faith","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>November 10, 2019<\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>BE EXAMPLES OF FAITH<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:2 Corinthians 5:1-10<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:1 Thessalonians 2:1-10<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>\u201cAnd so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.\nThe Lord\\'s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia \u2014\nyour faith in God has become known everywhere.\u201d<b>1 Thessalonians 1:7-8a<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Understand the meaning of being\nexamples in faith.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Identify reasons why some contemporary Christians are not exemplary in faith.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>State practical ways Christians can\nbe examples to others in the society.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n<li>Recite the memory verse and\nexplain its significance.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Vaba \u201cGood News\u201d as he was popularly called was a village pastor.

He preached the Gospel with passion so much that he became a teacher\nto all, doctor to the sick, giver to the poor and a counsellor to the depressed. During his\nth 60 birthday party, which was organised by the youths of the church, everyone agreed\nwith the testimony that baba \u201cGood News\u201d was an example of faith to the young and old\nin the community and its surroundings. The most interesting aspect of baba\\'s testimony\nwas that from time to time, he encouraged his children to be exemplary in the faith,\nhospitable and ready to preach the good news whenever they have the opportunity, so\nthat they can become models to others. Just as baba desired, his only son became a\npastor and his daughters were known for their faith, self-less service and dedication to\nthe work of God in their various churches.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Thessalonica was a large and populous city and the capital of one of the four Roman\ndistricts of Macedonia. During his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the\nsynagogue and also laid the foundation of a church (Acts 17:1-4; 1 Thessalonians\n1:9).Paul worked among them very shortly and then sent Timothy there to continue the\nwork. In his letter to them, he commended the people for their exemplary faith,\nhospitality and abstinence from idolatry. Eventually, the life of the Christians in\nThessalonica became a model for others; and for this, Paul commended them. This is the\nfocus of today\\'s lesson.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Commendation for Commitment to Faith 1 Thessalonians 1:2-6<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in the church at Thessalonica in\ncommendation and thanksgiving for their life. He also commended their faith and,\nprayed for them. Apart from their exemplary lifestyle, he also commended them for the\nfollowing:<ol>\n<li>Their works, which were produced by faith, labour prompted by love and endurance\ninspired by hope through Jesus Christ.<\/li>\n<li>The confidence that they were chosen to be saved by God\\'s grace.<\/li>\n<li>How they received the Gospel based on deep conviction.><\/li>\n<li>How they became imitators of them (Paul and his colleagues) and of the Lord.<\/li>\n<li>How they received the Gospel, even in the face of severe persecution. Nevertheless, for Paul, it\nwas joy and a gift from the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17), and not just human emotion.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It is not uncommon to see some Christians compromise their faith as a result of\npersecution. But for the Christians in Thessalonica, they demonstrated faith despite their\nsuffering. Hence, Paul commended them like he earlier mentioned at the beginning of\nhis letter to them. Also noteworthy in the passage is the effort of Paul and his colleagues who laboured hard to bring the good news to the brethren in Thessalonica. They did not\nonly do so with mere words but with power, the Holy Spirit and complete conviction of its\ntruth; thus they encouraged the brethren to imitate them and the Lord. The\ncommendation of the good done in the past can spur a better performance in people\\'s\nlives. The church today must learn to encourage and commend believers concerning\ntheir disposition to the Gospel, especially these days of great hostility. If people are\nregularly commended and encouraged for their labour of love, they will grow to be more\ncommitted and eventually become good models to other believers.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss the significance of commendation in relation to commitment.\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Compare and contrast the effects of condemning people rather than correcting them\nin love. <\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>What do you think the church of today can learn from the people of\nThessalonica?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Commendation for Exemplary Faith 1 Thessalonians 1:7-10<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The lifestyle of the Thessalonian Christians was greatly commended by Apostle Paul.\nParticularly, he was impressed by their exemplary faith, which made them examples to\nall the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. He said, \u201cAnd so you became a model to all the\nbelievers in Macedonia and Achaia.\u201d (v. 7) Apart from being models to the Macedonians\nand Achaians, Paul also commended them in other areas. He said:<ol>\n<li>Their exemplary faith had spread beyond Macedonia and Achaia to Christians in other\nplaces (v. 8);<\/li>\n<li>The testimony from other people about their hospitality to them (Paul and his\ncolleagues) when they visited them;<\/li>\n<li>Their abstinence from idolatry and how they have turned to God, to serve the true\nliving God (v. 9);<\/li>\n<li>Their readiness to wait for the second coming of our Lord Jesus.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The tone of Paul in the passage is an indication that he was truly impressed with the faith\nand exemplary lifestyle of the believers in Thessalonica. Undoubtedly, such affirmation can\nspur and encourage people to do better, unlike his tone in his letter to the Galatians that was\nharsh and unfriendly (Galatians 3:1-3). However, it should be noted that Paul did not spare\nanyone for their sinful act just as he commended them for their good Christian conduct. In his\nletter to the Christians at Corinth, he said that he would not spare those who had sinned after\nbeing taught the truth (2 Corinthians 13:2b). Therefore, Paul\\'s method should be adopted.\nFaith and exemplary Christian lifestyle should be encouraged and sinners corrected in love.\nAbove all, the church should be a place where examples of faith are modelled as a standard\nfor the society to emulate just like the people of Thessalonica were known everywhere.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>How can Christians influence their families, churches and the community they live\nin?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Which area of your church life do you think God will commend?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>What preparation should Christians make for the second coming of Jesus?\n<\/li>\n\t\t<li>How do you feel anytime you are commended for doing well in your Christian\nfaith?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Lord, help me to put my faith into practice, even when it is not convenient.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray for those who are yet to receive Christ<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Pray that God will help you to be exemplary in your faith to others.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Locate like-minded members in your church with whom you can continue to pray for\nthose who need God to help them remain committed to their faith and be exemplary to\nothers.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Christians should be firm in faith, even in the midst of persecution and trials.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Believers should be ready to set an example for others to follow at their workplace,\nschool, home and society.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>Commendation is a means of encouraging people to do more.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>It is good to commend people whenever they do well.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>It is the duty of believers to pray for the unsaved to receive Christ.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>God expects believers to be models to others.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Jesus\\' second coming is certain and imminent.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n"},{"id":46,"title":"live holy lives","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>November 17, 2019<\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>LIVE HOLY LIVES<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:1 Peter 1:3-12<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Galatians 5:22-23; 1 Peter 1<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t<p>Lesson Scripture:1 Peter 1:13-25<\/p>\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.\nBut just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do.<b>1 Peter 1:14b-15<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Define holiness according to the passage.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Identify the different ways Christians are\nconforming to the standard of the\nworld today and discuss how to\novercome them.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Discuss the process of humankind\\'s\nredemption.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n<li>Make a commitment to be holy just as\nour Father who is in heaven is holy.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Sister Joy Enomagbon is one of the Bible study coordinators on campus. She has been Sknown for her piety and disciplined lifestyle right from childhood. The topic for\ndiscussion during one Bible study was \u201cBe Holy\u201d and the text was taken from 1 Peter\n1:13-25. By the time she finished the study, the fellowship was divided by different\nopinions. While Sister Joy and some other students believed holiness includes outward\nappearance like dressing, the friends we keep and what we eat, others claimed that it is\nsimply a desire to live according to the standard of God, to live a life free of sins and be\ncompletely separated from one\\'s former lifestyle. A few others also claimed that it is not\nhumanly possible to be holy in this perverse generation. However, it took the effort of a\npastor to explain to the different parties that to be holy is the same thing as to be righteous,\nconsecrated or sanctified. Simply put, it is a lifestyle that is free from sin and not necessarily\na superficial appearance that is usually deceptive. At last, they all agreed with the pastor\\'s\ndefinition of holiness and promised to continue to live in holiness with the help of the Holy\nSpirit.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Some Christians have abused the concept of holiness in our contemporary time so\nmuch that it has led to mockery and scorn. They claim to be holy just because they dress\nin a particular way, when actually their character does not reflect Christ. They enjoy\nliving in sin, even though they claim to have accepted Jesus as their Saviour and Lord. In\nour passage today, Apostle Peter wrote to the recipients of his letter to abstain from\nworldliness and live holy lives, in order to prepare for eternity.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Call to Holy Living 1 Peter 1:13-16<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Peter wrote this letter of encouragement to a group of believers who were\nscattered throughout the northern part of Asia Minor as a result of persecution. The\nmain purpose of the letter was to encourage them to accept and endure their suffering\nas a test of the genuineness of their faith, with the confidence that they will be rewarded\nat \u201cthe appearing of Jesus Christ\u201d (v. 7). According to verse 13, even though they were\npersecuted, Peter admonished them to exhibit some Christian characters that show the\nreality of the new life. Therefore, his encouragement was based on the following:<ol>\n<li>To prepare their minds for action;<\/li>\n<li>To maintain self-control;<\/li>\n<li>To set their hope completely on the blessing which will be given to them when Jesus\nChrist is revealed (Romans 8:18);<\/li>\n<li>To be obedient to God and not conform to their former evil ways of life when they\nwere ignorant. In other words, they should stick to God according to His revelation to\nthem in the person of Jesus Christ;<\/li>\n<li>To be holy as God who has called them is holy.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The admonition to be holy as a way of life became paramount for two reasons: because\nGod who has called them is holy and because of what He has done for them (1:18-20). The\nconcept of holiness is prominent, even in the Old Testament. For instance, God commanded\nMoses to speak to the Israelites saying,\u201cSpeak to all the congregation of the people of Israel\nand say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy\u201d (Leviticus 19:2; 11:44-\n45). Therefore, the issue of holiness for the people of God is not negotiable.<\/p>\n<p>The word \\'Holiness\\' simply means to abstain from all traces and appearances of evil.\nThe contemporary church is not exempted from the admonition to be holy, especially in\nthis wicked and perverse generation where sin and all forms of ungodliness are\nprevalent. Unfortunately, instead of Christians to heed God\\'s command, the issue of\nholiness is being trivialised. However, it must be stated that the charge to live holy as\nChristians, because God Himself is holy, is still paramount. The author of Hebrews also\nstressed the need to be holy when he said,\u201cMake every effort to\u2026be holy; without\nholiness no one will see the Lord.\u201d (Hebrews 12:14) Apart from the fact that God has\ncommanded us to be holy, the life of holiness brings joy, divine blessings, happiness and\nrespect, even among fellow humans.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss some practical steps one can take to live holy from day-to-day, especially in\nthis corrupt world.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Which action do you think Peter meant in verse 13?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>How can a Christian be completely separated from his\/her former\nlifestyle?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Reminder to Prepare for Eternity 1 Peter 1:17<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Peter\\'s admonition to his recipients was comprehensive. Having stressed the need to\nlive holy, he made it clear to them that God is an impartial Judge who will judge all the\npeople with the same standard. He said, \u201cSince you call on a Father who judges each\nman\\'s work impartially\u2026.\u201d (1 Peter 1:17a) The other aspect of the reminder was a call to\nlive as strangers in this world particularly with reverent fear. \u201c\u2026 live your lives as\nstrangers here in reverent fear.\u201d (v. 17b) Indeed, this is a reminder to live with the\nconsciousness that we are not permanent sojourners here on earth. Therefore, we must\nbe prepared to live in holiness because someday, at the end of our journey here on earth,\nwe will meet with God to be judged according to our activities.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>One of the attributes of God is that He is not partial in His judgment. In other words, He\ndoes not judge wrongly like a human judge who is not consistent and sometimes induced\nto give judgment in favour of one person against another. He will reward everyone\naccording to the kind of life they lived (Revelation 2:13). Interestingly, no one will escape\nHis judgment because it is an unavoidable plan of God. The writer of Hebrews affirmed this\nwhen he said, \u201cJust as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.\u201d (Hebrews 9:27) Invariably, Peter\\'s reminder to his addressee was a call to prepare for\neternity. Nevertheless, while we are here on earth, we must live our lives with reverence\nand fear of God because He will surely reward us in due time (Revelation 16:15; 22:12).<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Do you believe in eternity?

According to verses 18 and 19 he said, \u201cFor you know that it was\nnot with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty\nway of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of\nChrist, a lamb without blemish or defect.\u201d Certainly, their redemption was not attained by\nperishable materials such as silver and gold but with the costly sacrifice of the blood of\nJesus, which was without flaws. From verses 20 to 25, he highlighted and called their\nattention to some other important things. For example, he said:<ol>\n<li>Jesus Christ has been chosen by God before the creation of the earth.<\/li>\n<li>They believe in God through Jesus Christ.<\/li>\n<li>God raised Christ from the dead; thus, their faith and hope should be in God.<\/li>\n<li>They should love one another sincerely since they have purified themselves.<\/li>\n<li>They have been born again not of perishable but of imperishable seed through the\nliving and enduring Word of God<\/li>\n<li>The Word of God is poten<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Contemporary believers must come to terms with the fact that redemption from the\npower of sin is total dependence and surrender to God completely.

They live in Lagos but are from\nthe Eastern part of Togo. It is customary for every indigene, notwithstanding\nwhere they live, to sacrifice a dove or a pigeon in appreciation to the god of the land for\nprotection and provision. The god is highly venerated and worshipped in their locality so\npeople from that community who live elsewhere would either go back home repeatedly\nor perform their monthly ritual wherever they live. The dedication of Mr and Mrs Kicks to\nthis practice prompted their son to wonder for some years the significance of the ritual.\nWhen he asked his parents the reason for their consistence and commitment to the\npractice, they explained that their forefathers served the god and they believed in its\npower to bless and sustain anyone who calls upon it. Therefore, they have been\ncommanded to stick to it without wavering, if they want to live properly. If people could\ndedicate their time and resources to serve a strange god, how much more should\nChristians be encouraged to stick to their faith in God, their son Bernard concluded.\nHowever, today\\'s lesson is quite different from the experience and dedication of Mr and\nMrs Kicks to the service of their god as they were taught.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>Apostle Peter wrote this second letter to a wide circle of the early Christians who\nwere scattered around the Middle East and Asia. His aim was to encourage them to stick\nto their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and to combat the work and teachings of some false\nteachers, which was already widespread among them. They were to hold on to the true\nknowledge of God through Christ, which had been conveyed to them.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>God\\'s Generosity to Humanity 2 Peter 1:1-4<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Peter wrote his second letter to Christians who were scattered throughout Pontus,\nGalatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. He identified himself as \u201ca servant and apostle of\nJesus Christ in verse1. Notable in the passage is the fact that he addressed his recipient\nas,\u201c\u2026 those who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ have\nreceived a faith as precious as ours.\u201d (v. 1b) In verse 2, he pronounced a benediction of grace\nand peace to them in an increasing measure through their knowledge of God through Jesus\nChrist. He affirmed that by God\\'s divine power, they have been given everything they need\nto live righteously through their knowledge of the One who has called them to have a share\nin His glory and goodness. Similarly, God has given to humanity, especially Christians great\nand precious gifts, which He had promised so that we may escape the lust of the world and\nhave a share of the divine nature (v. 4). As it is used in the passage, the promised gifts include the second coming of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:4), the new heaven and the new earth\n(2 Peter 3:13) and the right to enter into the eternal kingdom (2 Peter 1:11).<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>According to the confession of Peter, believers have actually enjoyed God\\'s\ngenerosity of salvation through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. This is because it is the will\nof God that everyone be saved through the death of Jesus Christ for the world (John\n3:16-18). Therefore, we can say that Jesus is God\\'s greatest gift to humanity. Peter said\nthat the kind of faith accorded these believers is such that is more precious and germane\nin comparison to other faiths in the world today. Therefore, it offers:<ol>\n<li>Pardon from sin. (John 3:16, 18)<\/li>\n<li>Priceless pardon. (Ephesians 2:8-9)<\/li>\n<li>Peace of mind from the guilt of sin.

Thankfully, these blessings are still in effect\ntoday for contemporary believers to enjoy. But care must be taken not to aim at getting the\nblessings only as against knowing God who gives the blessings; hence it is important to\nknow God first and all other things that He has promised will be given (Matthew 6:33).<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What should be our response to God\\'s generosity with the gift of\nsalvation?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the benefits the new faith offers to believers.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>How can believers enjoy the benefits of the faith as outlined in the\npassage?<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Admonition to Be Firm in the Faith 2 Peter 1:5-9<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Peter\\'s concern for the spiritual growth of his recipients is apparent in the passage.\nHaving revealed God\\'s great and precious gifts, which have been promised to\nhumankind, he further admonished them to make effort on the steps to growing in faith.\nIn verses 5 to 7, he carefully outlined the virtues that are necessary for their growth. He\nsaid, \u201c\u2026 make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;\nand to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; \u2026\u201d Peter was specific\nin verse 8; He said, \u201cFor if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive.\u201d In other words, anyone who\npossesses these qualities will become fruitful and active in the knowledge of the Lord\nJesus Christ. In contrast, Peter described those who do not possess these virtues as\nshort-sighted and blind having forgotten that they have been purified from their past\nsins (v. 9).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Obviously, Peter\\'s admonition to the Christians was to remain firm in the true\nknowledge of God and of Jesus Christ as the only antidote to combat false teachings in their\ndays. The virtues in verse 5 to 7 are synonymous with Paul\\'s appeal to the Galatians to\npossess the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23; Philippians 4:8). Therefore, to stick to their\nfaith is to remain unwavering in the profession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, without\ncompromise. He also emphasised that the benefits of growing in faith is productivity and\nfruitfulness in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But those who lack these qualities\nare blind and seem to have forgotten that they have been redeemed from their past sins (v.\n9). Peter\\'s counsel to his audience is applicable to contemporary Christians. We should\nunderstand the need to grow in grace and faith so that we will become more productive\nand useful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, we must work hard daily to\npossess these virtues so that we can become more productive Christians who will inherit\nthe kingdom of God.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss some practical evidences in the life of a person who possesses the qualities\nas mentioned in verses 5 to 7.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What are some things that contend with some people\\'s faith in Jesus Christ\ntoday?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>What practical steps can Christians take to possess these qualities?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>A Charge to Justify Salvation 2 Peter 1:10-15<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Apostle Peter\\'s admonition to his readers included a charge to justify God\\'s call and the\nchoice of saving them. Based on this, he appealed to them to work hard in order to make\ntheir calling and election by God sure and permanent so that they will not abandon their\nfaith. According to verses 10b and 11, Peter gave his reason for the counsel. He said, \u201c\u2026\nyou will never fall, and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our\nLord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d Peter, however, promised a constant reminder of the\nmatter, even though they have known them and are firmly grounded in the truth. And to\nhim, it was joy to always refresh their memory concerning the matters as long as he was\nalive (v.13). After all, his passion was as a result of the fact that his time on earth would\nsoon be over. Then he said, \u201cbecause I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus\nChrist has made clear to me.\u201d (v.14)\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Peter made it clear to the people that since they have been called and elected\nby God, they are duty bound to justify and sustain the calling. However, the word\n\\'Election\\' as it is used in this context does not mean that God is partial. After all, He began\nHis work of salvation for humankind since the fall of humankind in the garden of Eden.\nTherefore, only those who are saved and have justified their faith would be gladly\nwelcomed into God\\'s kingdom at the end of age. The willingness of Peter to constantly\nremind the people to justify their salvation and stick to their faith to the end is worth\nmentioning (vv. 14-15).

These are usually accompanied by music, food, and sometimes the display\nof wealth such as the display of good clothing, shoes and bags to match. Such was the\ncase of the Israelites when the ark of the covenant of God was brought back to\nJerusalem. It was earlier captured by the Philistines (1 Samuel 4:11), and remained with\nthem for a period of seven months (1 Samuel 6:1); thereafter, it was at Kiriath Jearim for\nanother 20 years (1 Samuel 7:2). Having established Jerusalem as the national capital,\nDavid assembled all Israel to bring the ark, in a grand ceremonial procession, to\nJerusalem.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The focus of today\\'s lesson is how David initiated the return of the ark of God (the\ncovenant box) to Jerusalem. As a result of his concern for the temple and its worship, the\npriests, Levites, and all the people of Israel played important roles in moving the covenant\nbox to Jerusalem. In fact, to the Israelites, it was a landmark in their life and history, which\nwas marked with great celebrations and sacrifices, music and shouts of joy unto the LORD.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>David Summons All Israel 1 Chronicles 15:1-3<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Today\\'s passage is a description of the origin of how David initiated the worship of God in\nthe temple in Jerusalem. David\\'s fame spread everywhere, having defeated the\nPhilistines and driven them back from Gibeon to Gezer (1 Chronicles 14:16-17).\nThereafter, he undertook several major building projects in Jerusalem, including the\nconstruction of his own house and a tent for the ark of God (1 Chronicles 15:1).\nTherefore, the return of the ark of the covenant was a high point. He said to the people,\n\u201cNo one but the Levites may carry the ark of God because the LORD chose them to carry\nthe ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever.\u201d (v. 2) for this reason, David also\nsummoned all the people of Israel to gather together in Jerusalem in readiness to bring\nthe covenant box to the place that had been prepared for it.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The ark of the covenant was a symbolic representation of God\\'s presence among His\npeople. The tabernacle was constructed so that the Lord would be among His people:\n\u201cAnd let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.\u201d (Exodus 25:8) The\nfact that the ark represented God\\'s presence among His people brought great assurance to them. David\\'s concern and dedication to moving the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, a\nplace already prepared for it is worth mentioning. In contrast to the first attempt, he\ntook complete charge of the second attempt and personally enforced that only the\nLevites would carry it according to God\\'s command (v. 2). Indeed, his concern and\nparticipation in the return of the the ark of the Lord stands in direct opposition to Saul\\'s\nneglect (1 Chronicles 13:3).<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What would have motivated David to prepare a place for the ark of the covenant of\nGod?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Why did David involve all Israel in moving the covenant box to Jerusalem and what\nlessons can we learn from it?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Consecration and Service 1 Chronicles 15:14-16<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>As the plans to carry the ark to Jerusalem was ongoing, David summoned the heads of\nthe Levitical families and told them to consecrate themselves in readiness to bring the\nark of the Lord to the place he had prepared for it in Jerusalem (vv. 11-12). According to\nverse 13, the reason for the consecration was to avoid the Lord\\'s wrath against them for\nnot doing it as prescribed by God (1 Chronicles 15:12-13). Then, the priests and Levites\nconsecrated themselves (a ritual that involves washing in order to avoid ceremonial\ndefilement) before they could carry the ark. In accordance with God\\'s instruction\nthrough Moses, the ark was carried by the Levites with two poles on their shoulders. In\nverse 16, David commanded the leaders of the Levites to give different assignments to\nthe Levites to sing and play joyful music with harps and cymbals to commemorate the\nevent. From the family of singers, some men were chosen to play on the different\nmusical instruments (vv. 17-24). This singular act is an indication that the role of music in\nmeaningful worship cannot be over-emphasised. It is an essential element that\npromotes worship that can evoke diverse emotional responses. Little wonder David had\nsome musicians at the place of worship in Jerusalem after the covenant box was moved\nthere (1 Chronicles 6:31). Therefore, churches, families and individuals should learn to\ncelebrate landmark events that are memorable with joy and great music but most\nimportantly, sincere worship.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Everything about the movement of the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem was done\naccording to God\\'s command. Particularly, the command from Moses to the priests and\nLevites to sanctify themselves before they could carry the ark is acknowledged.\nObviously, the need for such instruction was to avoid defilement and to guard against God\\'s punishment on the people. Invariably, we can say that obedience remains the key\nto enjoying the blessings of God for His people. As the people received and obeyed\nMoses\\' instructions, so they obeyed God in all their plans to move the ark of the Lord to\nJerusalem. While the Levites carried the ark, David involved the entire nation of Israel in\nthe celebration of the event, which was typical of the Jewish festivals (Leviticus 23).<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>DisDiscuss some important events you think can be celebrated by Christian\nfamilies.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the importance of division of labour in church and family projects (v.\n16).<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>The Ark Brought to Jerusalem 1 Chronicles 15:25-29<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>The movement of the covenant box to Jerusalem was a historic event in the life of the people\nof Israel. The command for the Levites and priests to consecrate themselves and play various\nmusical instruments throughout the journey was strictly followed. King David, the leaders of\nIsrael and captains went to the house of Obed Edom to carry the covenant box. Because God\nhad helped the Levites who were carrying the ark, they made sacrifices of seven bulls and\nseven sheep and had a great celebration of the occasion. King David wore an ephod (a\ngarment ordinarily worn by priests) and all the people who were involved were ceremonially\ndressed including the musicians, the leaders of Israel and the Levites. The event was\nmomentous, all the people of Israel accompanied the covenant box with shouts of joy and the\nsound of musical instruments like the trumpet, horns, cymbals and harps (v. 28), to the city of\nJerusalem. Unfortunately, in the midst of the celebration Michal, Saul\\'s daughter despised\nKing David who was dancing and leaping for joy as the ark was being brought to the city of\nJerusalem.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The return of the Ark of the Covenant to the city of Jerusalem under the leadership of\nKing David was the high point of the success of his reign; thus, the celebration was\nmemorable. The animal sacrifices that were made was to appreciate God for His help, the\nmusical concert and the company of the people of Israel added colour and significance to\nthe event. This is seen in David\\'s response as he danced to the admiration of all except\nMichal, the daughter of Saul who was discontented with him.

The climax of the day is the opportunity\ngiven to members of the church to share God\\'s wonderful dealings with them and\nmembers of their families as they take turns to sing songs of thanksgiving. It is usually a\ntime to remember their achievements, successes and breakthroughs. It was the turn of\nMrs Adegbite who lost her husband some months earlier in a ghastly motor accident.\nAlthough she was in tears, she came out with her three children singing songs of\nthanksgiving to God for His care, protection and deliverance from sickness and diseases.\nParticularly, she expressed her heartfelt gratitude to God because they (herself and the\nchildren) belong to God\\'s family. The pastor was overwhelmed with joy that Mrs Adegbite\ncould demonstrate maturity to the extent of seeing reasons to give thanks to God, even\nthough she was still mourning the sudden demise of her husband. The pastor, therefore,\nchallenged members to always have a heart filled with gratitude, notwithstanding their\ndifficulties like Mrs Adegbite.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The lesson of today focuses on the need for Christians to cultivate the attitude of\nthanking God for His manifold blessings like David admonished the people of Israel\nimmediately the ark was returned to Jerusalem. Israel was encouraged to proclaim what\nGod has done for them to other nations, to praise and worship Him with grateful hearts.\nSuch an attitude can be demonstrated through sincere worship and reverence for God\nwith thanksgiving offerings and testimonies of His goodness and mercy whenever we\nmeet for worship.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Encouragement to Give Thanks to God 1 Chronicles 16:8-12<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>King David and the people of Israel successfully took the covenant box to the tent, which he\nhad prepared for it and made sacrifices of burnt and fellowship offerings to God. He\nblessed the people and gave them food while he assigned some of the Levites to lead the\nworship with singing and praises (1 Chronicles 16:1-4). He encouraged them to continually\nworship God and give thanks to Him in the following manner:<ol>\n<li>To proclaim His message and tell the nations what He has done for them probably\nfrom the time He delivered them from the land of Egypt.

David\\'s admonition to the\npeople to remember God\\'s faithfulness to them, to continually praise and worship Him for\nall the miracles of old is applicable to all contemporary Christians. In fact, God\\'s blessings\nupon us are immeasurable, especially those things we never prayed for, yet we have\nenjoyed.

The need for His people not to forget God\\'s\ncovenant, which He made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is repeated in verses 15 to16\nand the promise to give them the land of Canaan as their inheritance (v. 18). Having\nmade this known, David said that even though they were few in number and have\nbecome foreigners in their own land; wandered from one country and kingdom unto\nanother, they still enjoyed the love of God. He did not allow anyone to oppress them\nunjustly. Instead, He protected them and even warned kings not to harm His chosen\nservants or touch His prophets.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Someone once described the love of God as deep as one can never imagine. God\\'s love\nand protection which the people of Israel enjoyed, despite their size in comparison with other\nnations is outstanding. For their sake, God warned kings against doing evil to His people and\nmade them know that they are His chosen servants and prophets whose lives are divinely\nprotected. Without doubt, it is an expression of love for a people who continually sinned\nagainst God. Even today, as many that call and trust in His name enjoy divine care. This of\ncourse, is a demonstration of God\\'s nature to love and protect His people from all dangers.\nTherefore, the best way believers can reciprocate this kind gesture is total obedience to God\nand sincere worship.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Who are the people that can be described today as God\\'s servants and\nprophets?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>List some attributes of God as highlighted in the passage and what it teaches\nus.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Encouragement to Praise God 1 Chronicles 16:23-29<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>David\\'s encouragement to God\\'s people to show gratitude and praise Him for His\nwonderful deeds among His people is repeatedly seen in this passage.

Subsequently, he affirmed the attributes of God. He said, \u201cFor great is the Lord\nand most worthy of praise, he is to be feared above all gods.\u201d (v. 25) He acknowledged\nthe fact that the gods of the other nations are simply idols but the Lord created the\nheavens, glory and majesty surround Him; power and joy fill His temple. By virtue of\nthese attributes, King David called on all the people of the earth to praise God, to give an\noffering in His temple and to bow down before the Holy One when He appears (vv. 28-\n29).\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The call to praise God and show forth gratitude to Him is a necessary message for all\nChristians primarily for His mighty deeds towards us. Such an attitude can be\ndemonstrated through sincere worship and reverence for God with our thanksgiving\nofferings, whenever we meet for worship. Unfortunately today, some people do not see\nreasons to give thanks to God because of some life challenges. They often forget that\nGod who was faithful to the people of Israel and defended their cause is alive to meet\ntheir needs. Therefore, the challenge today to all Christians is to cultivate the habit of\nshowing gratitude to God for His miraculous dealings with us in time past.

But when he thoughtfully pondered on the luxurious palace, which he\noccupies as a king, he was displeased with where the ark of the covenant was kept. As a\nmatter of concern, he lamented and expressed his displeasure to Prophet Nathan. He\nsaid to him, \u201cHere I am living in a house built of cedar, but the Lord\\'s covenant box is kept\nin a tent.\u201d (v. 1). Obviously, Nathan gave an approval to whatever David intended to do for\nGod without hearing from God probably because he considered it as good. However,\nthat same night, God spoke to Nathan that David had not been chosen to build a house\nfor Him. He said, \u201cGo and tell my servant David, \\'This is what the Lord says: You are not\nthe one to build me a house to dwell in.\u201d (v. 4) Although the reason for the rejection was\nnot specified in this passage, according to 1 Chronicles 22:5, it is noted that David had\nshed much blood in battles and so, he was not qualified to build a house for the Lord.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>David\\'s concern for the covenant box, which was under a tent while he was settled in\na magnificent palace, is remarkable.

Thereafter, He\nassured him of his favoured status by referring to him as \u201cmy servant David\u201d (v. 7). He\npromised to raise up his offspring after him, one of his own sons would be king after his\ndeath. He also promised the stability of the dynasty of his descendants (v. 11). This same\npromise is echoed by the psalmist (Psalm 89:3-4) and interpreted as a prophecy\nconcerning the coming Messiah (John 7:42; Acts 2:30). According to verse 12, God again\naffirmed that David\\'s son will be the one to build a temple for Him with a vow to make his\ndynasty last forever. He also assured David of a steady relationship between Him and his\nson just like the relationship that exists between God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ\n(Hebrews 1:5).

However, according to the New\nTestament understanding, the royal line of King David continues forever in the person of\nJesus Christ, whose reign is from everlasting to everlasting (Matthew 2:1-6; Luke 3:33).\nThis implies that God\\'s promise to David and his descendants has been fulfilled.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Discuss your reaction when your plans were thwarted or postponed\nsuddenly.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the implication of verse 13 for believers.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>What does God\\'s promise to give David\\'s son an everlasting dynasty mean to\nChristians?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>David Builds an Altar to the Lord 1 Chronicles 21:18, 21-27<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>When Israel sinned against God, He decided to plague them. But King David claimed\nresponsibility for the sin and asked God to punish him and his family and spare the people\n(v. 17). In verse 18, the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to build an altar to the\nLord at Araunah\\'s threshing place (vv. 18-19). David obeyed the command and requested\nAraunah to sell him the piece of land in order for him to build an altar unto the Lord with the\npromise to pay the full price. Interestingly, Araunah offered to give him the land for free as\nwell as oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing boards to use as fuel, and wheat to give as\nan offering (v. 23). Nevertheless, King David was determined to pay the full price because of\nhis desire to give something worthwhile to God. Finally, he made full payment of 600 gold\ncoins to Araunah; a reflection of the great significance of the land and David\\'s commitment\nto it. He built an altar and offered burnt and fellowship offerings. God responded to David\\'s\nprayer and his sacrifices with \u201cfire from heaven\u201d (v. 26), an indication of His approval and\nsanctity of the place as the site of the future temple. Eventually, God commanded the angel\nto withdraw his sword; another indication that the sacrifice was acceptable to Him.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>King David was truly a leader. Two things are prominent in this passage that confirms\nhis leadership example (1) He claimed responsibility for ordering the census, which\nangered God and almost made Him to punish the people (2) He was determined to pay\nthe full price of Araunah\\'s piece of land for building an altar to the Lord. Ordinarily, as a\nking, he would have given an order to seize the land without anybody\\'s approval. Little\nwonder his fellowship and burnt offerings, which only a part of the animal was burnt on\nthe altar and the rest was eaten by the worshippers was divinely approved by fire from\nheaven. Araunah\\'s generosity to give his piece of land to King David without any form of\ncompensation is also exemplary. Therefore, Christians should be ready to lead by\nexample and demonstrate generosity and total commitment to God and His kingdom\nwork as it is seen in the lives of King David and Araunah in today\\'s passage.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Compare David\\'s humility in his request for the piece of land belonging to Araunah\nwith the lifestyle of some leaders today who use their authority to seize people\\'s\nproperties, all in the name of power.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Describe Araunah\\'s generosity alongside the selfish attitude of some Christians today\nwho are not ready to offer any free service for God\\'s work .<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>What are some signs we see as God\\'s approval of our gifts and offering?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray and ask God not to bring calamity to your family and generation because of your\nsins.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray for Christians to be willing to give to support kingdom business.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>May my offerings and gifts be acceptable to God, in Jesus\\' Name.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Identify someone who is known to be generous and committed to the things of God,\nwrite a letter of encouragement and be committed to praying for him\/her.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>God\\'s promises for His people are sure to come to pass.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>God\\'s timing is different from ours.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>We should always show gratitude to God for His manifold blessings.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>We should always seek the face of God as we make plans for our future.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>God still reveals Himself to people to correct or rebuke.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Generosity is a sign of a regenerate heart.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Total obedience to God can turn away His wrath.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":51,"title":"graciously accepting praise","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>December 22, 2019 <\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTING PRAISE<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:1 Samuel 2:1-10<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:Luke 1:39-56<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>And Mary said, \u201cMy soul glorifies the Lord and my\nspirit rejoices in God my Saviour.\u201d<b>Luke 1:46-47<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Reflect on God\\'s promises in their\nlives and praise Him for His faithfulness.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Demonstrate (through specific\nprayers) a resolve to propagate the\ngood news of the birth of Jesus Christ.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Verbalise their personal commitment to always obey God and remain committed to Him.\n         Compose their own songs of praise to God who\nkeeps promises.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Mr and Mrs James George have been married for a period of time without having Mchildren of their own.

Mrs George became more depressed when both of them\nwere confirmed fit to have children from all the medical examinations conducted. Based on the\ncounsel of their pastor, the couple resolved to continue to wait on God for the blessing of children\nwithout any further medical consultation. After a while, the woman became pregnant. The day it\nwas medically confirmed, she went to the pastor and shared her joy with songs of praise to God\nwho has removed her reproach and shame of childlessness.<\/p>  <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>God sent an angel to announce to Mary that she will be the mother of the Saviour.\nBefore this time, Mary had been engaged to Joseph. However, having been convinced by\nthe angel about the supernatural nature of the Child and the conception, Mary accepted\nand surrendered to the will of God. She decided to visit her cousin Elizabeth who was\nalready six months pregnant to confirm the promise. The meeting was a special one\nbecause Mary shared her joy and the faithfulness of God, especially as both of them\nwere people whose circumstances seemed impossible, like the case of Mrs George.<\/p>\n\n     \n\n        <h4>THE LESSON EXPLAINED<\/h4>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n\n        <!-- BEGINNING OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n        \n        <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Affirmation of the Promise Luke 1:39-42<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Last week, we established the fact that God promised to make one of David\\'s sons king,\nto keep his kingdom strong and make sure his dynasty continue forever (1 Chronicles\n17:11, 14). However, this promise was fulfilled in the prophecy of the birth of Jesus\nChrist. The role of the Holy Spirit in the conception of the Saviour cannot be overemphasised\nbecause what happened to Mary could not have been possible, humanly\nspeaking. In a bid to confirm what had happened to her cousin, Elizabeth, she decided to\ntravel to visit her in Judea, a journey of about 100 kilometres from Jerusalem. With\nexcitement, she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. According to\nverse 41, when Elizabeth heard Mary\\'s greeting, the baby in her womb (Jesus\\'\nforerunner) leaped for joy, the beginning of the fulfilment of his role as one who would\ndeclare and prepare for the Lord\\'s coming. Immediately, Elizabeth was filled with the\npower of the Holy Spirit and she started to prophesy. She declared the uniqueness of\nMary\\'s child saying, \u201cYou are the most blessed of all women and blessed is the child you\nwill bear.\u201d (v. 42) Evidently, the declaration was an affirmation of God\\'s promise to Mary\nthrough the angel as well as a display of an extraordinary affection for the unborn child.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>The action of Mary in these few verses is a confirmation that she believed the\nmessage of the angel. In addition, her visit to Elizabeth is peculiarly significant for some reasons. First, she visited Elizabeth\\'s place as a sign of affirmation of God\\'s promise.\nSecond, the Holy Spirit revealed the divinity of the unborn child to Elizabeth. Therefore,\nElizabeth\\'s declaration about Mary and her child brought Mary great honour in the\nwhole wide world, which she expressed with great excitement.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Let at least two class members share their experiences of the manifestation of God\\'s\npower after taking some steps of faith.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss the significance of the baby in Elizabeth\\'s womb that leaped for joy at the\nsound of Mary\\'s voice (v. 41).<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>Affirmation through Elizabeth Luke 1:43-45<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>Mary\\'s visit to her cousin Elizabeth was purposeful. Some people believe it was to share\nher joy of being the mother of the Saviour, to confirm the message of the angel about\nElizabeth\\'s conception at her old age or to praise God together for the uncommon\nmiracles of the conception. Nevertheless, Mary\\'s arrival in the home of Elizabeth fulfilled\nthe purpose of her visit. As a reflection of her commitment, Elizabeth was overwhelmed\nand confessed that the unborn child was her Lord (v. 43), the first time a human would\ncall Jesus \u201cLord\u201d. She simply said, \u201cHappy you are to believe that the Lord\\'s message to\nyou will come to pass\u201d. Certainly, this was an affirmation from Elizabeth, of God\\'s plan for\nMary as the mother of the Messiah. Without doubt, the confession would have served as\nan encouragement and strength to Mary about the divine nature of the unborn child.\nMoreover, Elizabeth affirmed in verse 45 that God\\'s promise to Mary, as the mother of\nthe Saviour is an evidence that God was actually at work in the conception of the Saviour.\nInvariably, the same God who revealed His plans to Mary through the angel also affirmed\nHis plans through Elizabeth in her declaration about the unborn child.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>God has the plan of our lives in His hands.

Mary could not hide\nher joy, hence, she composed a song of praise in appreciation of God\\'s favour. This song is\nalso known as the Magnificat taken from the first word of the song in Latin, which means\n\u201cmagnifies\u201d Having praised and acknowledged God for the favour, she carefully\nreflected on her humble and lowly background. In other words, God penetrated through\nher obscurity to bring her into limelight as the mother of the Saviour. She also reflected\non God\\'s concern for the poor, disadvantaged, and powerless as well as God\\'s judgment\non the arrogant, proud, and self-absorbed. In verse 54, she expressed the fulfilment of\n the promise God made to their ancestors, the people of Israel to show mercy to\nAbraham and his descendants forever. Mary stayed with Elizabeth, her cousin, for a\nperiod of about three months before she went back to Nazareth.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>Mary was a woman of faith who demonstrated obedience to God when she received\nthe news of becoming the mother of the Saviour of the world. She could not hide her\n excitement in her song of praise, she confessed that God has helped the humble, and\nshown His compassion and kindness to those who honour Him with holy living. God\\'s\nfavour upon Mary would definitely have a positive effect on her because the people of all\nages would see her as highly blessed by God (v. 48). Mary\\'s song of praise is a reminder of\nHannah\\'s prayer (1 Samuel 2:1-10) and many of the psalms that are composed to praise\nGod and extol His attributes. God always remembers His covenant of mercy with His\npeople, no matter what. He promised in the Old Testament that the whole world will be\nblessed through the seed of Abraham and now it has come to pass through the birth of\nJesus Christ, the Saviour of the world. In fact, the summary of Mary\\'s song is God\\'s\nfaithfulness to the covenant He made with Abraham because the birth of Jesus is the\nfulfilment of that promise.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why is God interested in using the humble to exercise His power and establish His\npurpose?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>How, and for what reasons should Christians magnify God?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>What does Mary\\'s attitude in the passage teach us?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Thank God for the gift of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray that God will give you and members of your family reasons to celebrate Him this\nseason.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Pray for those who have not received Jesus as their Saviour and Lord.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Encourage class members to recall what God has done for them and their family\nmembers since the beginning of the year and compose a song of praise in appreciation\nto Him.<\/li>\n<li>They should ask God for grace to enable them listen faithfully to Him and rely only on\nHim for confirmation and fulfilment of promises.<\/li>\n       \n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        \n       <h4> Take Home <\/h4>\n\n        <ul>\n\n        <li>Obedience to God and His Word is rewarding.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 1-->\n        <li>Christians have their different roles to play in furthering God\\'s kingdom.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 2-->\n        <li>It is good to praise God for His wonderful deeds in our lives.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 3-->\n        <li>God is a covenant keeping God.<\/li> <!-- Take Home 4-->\n\t\t<li>God blesses the humble and resists the proud.<\/li>\n\t\t<li>Believers should be ready always to share the good news of the birth of Jesus.<\/li>\n        <\/ul>"},{"id":52,"title":"david's prayer","message":"<center>\n\n            <h4>December 29, 2019<\/h4> <!--DATE-->\n            <h3>DAVID'S PRAYER<\/h3> <!--TOPIC-->\n\n        <div>\n        <p> Devotional Reading:Psalm 89:19-37<\/p> <!--Devotional Reading Passage-->\n        <p> Background Scripture:1 Chronicles 17:16-27<\/p> <!-- Background Scipture Passage-->\t\n\t\t\n        <h4>Golden Text<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God\nbut you, as we have heard with our own ears.<b>1 Chronicles 17:20<\/b>    <\/p> <!-- Golden Text; Make Sure the scripture passage is made bold-->\n\n<\/center>\n        \n       \n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p> <!-- DONT TOUCH THIS-->\n\n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Analyse David\\'s prayer as it is in the\npassage.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 1-->\n        <li>Identify the various ways Christians\ncan show gratitude to God for His\nfaithfulness to them.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 2-->\n        <li>Discuss the importance of showing\ngratitude to God for His benefits\ntowards us.<\/li>   <!-- Objective 3-->\n<li>Make a decision to always thank\nGod for promises fulfilled.<\/li>\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n        <h4>INTRODUCTION<\/h4>\n        \n        <p>Mr Matthew Hassan is a popular politician.

He promised to make one of his sons king with an everlasting\ndynasty and put him in charge of the people and His kingdom forever (vv. 11-15). This\npromise was fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ (Matthew 2:1-6; 21:9). Having heard\nfrom Prophet Nathan everything God had revealed to him, David responded in an\nunusual way. He entered into the tent, sat down, and prayed saying, \u201cWho am I, O Lord\nGod, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?\u201d David\\'s prayer suggests\nthat he was pleased with the numerous promises made to him and his descendants.\nParticularly, he was happy because of the inclusion of his future generations (v. 17), even\nthough he was not worthy of the favour according to his expression. He confessed that\ntruly it was God\\'s will and purpose to reveal to him this great thing about his future.<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n<p>It should be noted that David\\'s prayer of thanksgiving came as a result of God\\'s promise\nto build for him a dynasty that will last forever. The phrase in verse 1b \u201cI am not worthy of\nwhat you have already done for me, LORD God, nor is my family\u201d is a sign of humility that he\ndid not merit the favour shown to him and his family. Moses and Gideon expressed same\nwhen they received God\\'s call (Exodus 3:11; Judges 6:15). God\\'s promise to David can be\nplaced alongside God\\'s other important deeds in the history of Israel like their deliverance from slavery in Egypt and His choice of them as His people (1 Chronicles 17:21, 22). The\npromises made to King David and his descendants can be likened to the favour we receive\nfrom God on daily basis. Therefore, David\\'s attitude of thanksgiving should motivate\nbelievers to always show gratitude to God for what He has done, what He is doing and the\nwonderful things He is yet to do. This can be done through the composition of songs of\npraise and thanksgiving, prayer, giving and spreading the good news of the Gospel to the\nunsaved.<\/p>\n\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Mention some promises God has made to you and your family members and how you\nhave shown gratitude to Him.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>What should be our response to God for His promises to us as believers?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n        \n        <\/ol>\n\n        <\/li> \n\n        <!-- END OF Lesson Explained  1-->\n\t\t      <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>David Eulogises God 1 Chronicles 17:20-22<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>David did not undermine God\\'s favour to him and his descendants.

Of His own volition, God chose the nation Israel\nas His own people and His wonderful miracles, which He did for them became wellknown.\nDavid\\'s attitude of praise and thanksgiving to God for His promises remains a\nmodel to Christians of all ages. We should cultivate the habit of praising God for the daily\nblessings and victories, which He has won for us, as well as making known His future\npromises to us.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>What does David\\'s prayer of thanksgiving teach us about God?\n<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Let some members share with the class God\\'s promised and fulfilled promises to\nthem since the beginning of the year.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n<li>Discuss what it means to trust God\\'s promises according to 1 Corinthians 1:26-31.<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  2-->\n\t\t\n\t\t <li> <!-- FIRST CHECK THE NUMBER OF LESSON EXPLAINED, THEN COPY THIS PART FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES  -->\n\n        <h5>David\\'s Appeal to God 1 Chronicles 17:23-27<\/h5> <!-- Lesson Explained Title 1-->\n\n        <p>King David did not only praise and thank God for His promises to him and his\ndescendants. He also made special appeal concerning the house, which He promised to\nestablish forever. His reason for the appeal is stated in verse 24, \u201cSo that it will be\nestablished and that your name will be great forever. Then men will say \\'The LORD\nAlmighty, the God over Israel, is Israel\\'s God! And the house of your servant David will be\nestablished before you.\u201dAccording to verse 25, David had the courage to make this\nappeal to God because He had revealed everything to Him concerning His plan to make\nhis descendants kings to him. Therefore, he acknowledged the LORD as God who has\nmade the good promises to His servant David and prayed that the blessing would remain\nforever.\n<\/p> <!-- Paragraph 1-->\n\n        <p>The word \\'Almighty\\' according to David\\'s description of God is a title which refers to God as\nthe Commander of Israel\\'s armies or of the heavenly power. Of course, this is a sign that David\nhad a close relationship with God; thus, he was courageous enough to approach and appeal to\nHim to fulfil His promises concerning him and his descendants. Specifically, he prayed in verse 27\nto bless his descendants so that they will continue to enjoy God\u2019s favour and that His blessing will\nrest on them forever. Interestingly, all the promises God made to David and his descendants were\nfulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\n        <h5>DISCUSSION TIME<\/h5>\n\n        <ol>\n        \n        <li>Why did David repeat what God had promised to do for him and his descendants in his\nprayer?<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 1-->\n        <li>Discuss how Christians can avoid repetition when they pray.<\/li> <!-- Discussion Question 2-->\n\t\t<li>What does David\\'s prayer reveal to us about God?<\/li>\n\n       \n        <\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<!-- END OF Lesson Explained  3-->\n\t\t\n        \t\t\n        <\/ol>\n\t\t\n\t\t<h4>Commitment Based on Today\\'s Lesson<\/h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n        \n        <li>My Personal Commitment <\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment to My Church<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        <li>Commitment towards My Relationship with Others<\/li> <!--Commitment-->\n        \n        <\/ul>\n\n\n        <h4> Prayer Points <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Pray to God to fulfil all His promises concerning you and your family before the end of\nthe year.\n<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 1-->\n        <li>Pray for God\\'s favour and mercy, especially as the year runs to an end.<\/li> <!-- Prayer Point 2-->\n\t\t<li>Ask God to give you grace to serve Him to the end.<\/li>\n\t\t \n        \n        <\/ul>\n    \n         <h4> Fellowship and Ministry Building Activities <\/h4>\n        \n        <ul>\n        \n        <li>Ask members to think of a time in their lives when they received unmerited blessing\nfrom God.
